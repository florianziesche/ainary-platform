# AR-002 The Trust Tax

## Executive Summary

- 99% of enterprises deploying [[AI]] report financial losses, averaging $4.4M per company (EY RAI Pulse, n=975 C-suite)
- Workslop rework costs $186/employee/month in [[AI]]-heavy workflows — $9M/year at 10K employees (Stanford/HBR)
- Shadow [[AI]] breach premium: $670K above standard breach ($4.63M total, 247 days to detect)
- Organizations with fragile [[AI]] governance miss 40% of projected productivity gains (EY)
- Calibration infrastructure costs $0.005/check vs. €35M EU [[AI]] Act penalties — 333x to 3,333x ROI on prevention

## Key Insights

- **Five hidden line items:** Rework Tax ($186/employee/month), Shadow Tax ($670K breach premium), Confidence Tax (18% trust drop despite 13% usage increase), Compliance Tax ($2-5M EU setup), Opportunity Tax (34% more likely revenue growth with monitoring)
- **Trust Debt compounds:** Like technical debt but worse — retroactive trust infrastructure costs 5-10x proactive deployment
- **Alert fatigue doom loop:** 67% of SOC alerts ignored + 80-99% healthcare false positives = HITL becomes rubber stamp
- **[[AI]] insurance gap:** 99% of enterprises report [[AI]] losses, but insurers exclude [[AI]] liability without clear pricing model
- **Klarna overpivot lesson:** $60M claimed savings, 853 FTEs replaced, then partial rollback — metrics mask quality degradation

## Sales Angles

- "You're already paying $4.4M in [[AI]]-related losses. We help you measure the Trust Tax across 5 hidden line items — then eliminate them for $135/month in calibration infrastructure."
- "The window between 'optional' and 'mandatory' [[AI]] governance closes August 2026. €35M EU penalties vs. $2-5M compliance cost. Build defensibility now."
- "Your [[AI]] transformation ROI is 40% lower than projected because of fragile talent foundations. We fix the foundation — trust infrastructure — so [[AI]] actually delivers."
