## Learnings

### Competitive Advantages (Florian's Profile)

#### Unique Strengths
1. ✅ **Operator credibility:** Former CEO, real fundraising experience (€5.5M+)
2. ✅ **Technical depth:** [[AI]]/[[LLM]] expertise (not just MBA generalist)
3. ✅ **Enterprise experience:** BMW, Siemens, Bosch = understanding enterprise sales cycles
4. ✅ **VC training:** [[VC Lab]] Fellow ([[Decile]] Group) = speak the language
5. ✅ **Founder empathy:** Been through fundraising, hiring, pivoting

- **Sourcing edge:** Founder network + understanding what technical founders need
- **Investment lens:** Know what actually matters vs. vanity metrics

---

### Potential Objections & Counters

| Objection | Counter |
|-----------|---------|
| "You'll just go start another company" | "I've learned investing is where I can have 10x the impact — helping multiple founders vs. one company" |
| "You're overqualified for associate role" | "I want to learn the craft properly — [[VC]] is a long-term career, not a stepping stone" |
| "Why [[VC]] vs. staying a founder?" | "I'm more energized by pattern recognition across multiple companies than single-company execution" |

---

### Market Context (February 2026)

#### Industry Trends
- ⚠️ **Tighter hiring:** Some funds trimmed teams (Initialized, NFX, Greycroft)
- ✅ **[[AI]] still hot:** [[AI]]-focused funds continue to raise and deploy capital
- ✅ **Operator backgrounds valued:** Market favors those who've built, not just analyzed
- ⚠️ **Competition:** Many founders transitioning to [[VC]]

#### Timing Considerations
- **Good time to look:** Early in year = when funds plan hiring for year ahead
- **Patient approach:** Most funds hire slowly, build relationships over months
- **Network effect:** VC hiring is 80% network, 20% application (leverage [[VC Lab]]!)

#### Salary Expectations (Associate Level, NYC)
- **Seed funds (Betaworks size):** $85K - $125K base + carry
- **Larger funds (General Catalyst):** $100K - $150K base + carry
- **Top-tier (Lux, Greylock):** $120K - $175K base + meaningful carry
- **Note:** Carry becomes meaningful after 4-5 years (long-term game)
