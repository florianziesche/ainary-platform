## Essay 1: Nascent Market Opportunity

> HOF Capital's ideal investment is one in which the firm is the first VC investor in a startup that ultimately becomes a generational category-leading company [...] What is one "nascent market opportunity" that you think could plausibly lead to a generational category-leading company being built in the long term? Why?

**→ See [[nascent-market-answer]] Option 2 (Sharp & Short)**

Everyone is building bigger AI models. The real opportunity is one layer above: the infrastructure for AI agents that participate in the economy.

Google, Anthropic, and the Linux Foundation are already shipping the protocols. McKinsey puts the market at $5 trillion by 2030. Bessemer calls it 10x bigger than SaaS because it replaces labor spend, not software spend.

I work with these systems daily — running multi-agent workflows across real tools and APIs. They break in four places: agents forget everything between sessions, they can't pay for anything, they can't verify who they're dealing with, and they don't understand consequences. Each of those gaps is a company waiting to be built.

The first three are solvable now. The fourth requires world models, the ability to simulate cause and effect before acting. DeepMind, Meta, and World Labs are all racing toward this. When agents get it, they go from tools to autonomous participants.

The opportunity is the platform layer where agents find services, negotiate, build trust, and settle payments. The protocols exist. The platform doesn't. This is the internet in 1995.

It's $1T+ because it doesn't replace one industry. It adds a new participant to all of them.

## Essay 2: Most Impressive Accomplishments

> What are the most impressive things that you've accomplished in your professional and/or academic career? What makes each of these accomplishments so impressive?

**1. AI startup: PMF, $1M+ revenue, $5.5M raised.**
Co-founded a computer vision company in Munich. Reached product-market fit and closed BMW, Siemens, Bosch, Magna, and Linamar on six-figure contracts. Grew annual contract value from $240K to over $1M in one year. Raised $5.5M across angel, venture, and grant rounds. Hired 15+ people.

**2. Credit risk ML at BNP Paribas: +15 percentage points.**
My master thesis at TUM was the first machine learning approach at BNP Paribas Consors Finanz's Munich office. I tested over 500 model variations on 168K credit applications. Result: improved the GINI coefficient from 56% (production baseline) to 71%. On a portfolio with €5.5B in revenue and €1.2B in cost of risk, a 1% reduction in default losses saves roughly €12M per year.

**3. Multi-agent system that compounds.**
Six months ago I saw that AI becomes a competitive advantage only when you build it as a compounding system, not use it as a tool. I built one. It runs my research, content, outreach, and coordination. Every output feeds back as context for the next cycle. The quality compounds. My nascent market thesis came from operating at that boundary, not from reading about it.
