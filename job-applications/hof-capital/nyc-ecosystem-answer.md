# HOF Capital — NYC Venture Ecosystem Answer

## Option 2 (Sharp)

NYC did $28.5B in VC in 2024, 13% of the U.S. total. Second only to the Bay Area. What makes it interesting isn't the number but the density: founders, VCs, and buyers concentrated in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with startup events almost every night.

Software's share of NYC venture went from under 40% in 2019 to over 50% in 2024. For someone who builds and invests in AI, that shift matters.

The gap I see: nobody is doing vertical AI at seed. NYC has generalist funds everywhere and a few doing horizontal AI infrastructure, but almost none focused on AI for specific industries like manufacturing, industrial, or legal. That will change as generative AI compounds. The other gap: NYC is the most international city in the country, but there's no fund that systematically connects European AI startups with the U.S. market.

I'm based in New York and fully committed to the NYC ecosystem. I'm currently in Germany for a family matter through March, but I'm not sitting still. I'm networking with VC Lab cohort members, leading the planning for our NYC meetup next month, and building relationships with peers connected to NYC-based funds. When I return in March, I'll have in-person meetings already lined up.
