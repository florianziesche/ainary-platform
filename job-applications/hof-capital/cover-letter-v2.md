# HOF Capital — Application Email

**To:** HOF Capital Team
**Subject:** VC Associate / Senior Associate — Florian Ziesche

---

I saw your Associate and Senior Associate roles and wanted to reach out. HOF Capital's focus on AI-native companies and your investments in OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI tell me you take technical depth seriously — not just the hype cycle. That's exactly the kind of fund I want to work at.

I'm not a finance person who got interested in AI. I spent five years building an AI startup from nothing — demos, MVPs, product-market fit, sales from zero to over $1M in revenue. I raised $5M across angel and VC rounds, sat in hundreds of meetings with funds, hired a team of 15, fired people, ran out of money, and kept going. I went through Alchemist Accelerator and multiple programs in Germany and the U.S., and I recently helped a company get into YC as their operating mentor.

That journey is what I bring. I can read founders because I was one. I know who's delusional in a good way and who's delusional in a dangerous way — because I've been both. I recently helped a company get into YC as their operating mentor. I have an existing network of angels, VCs, and founders who trust me because I did the work, not because I wrote a check.

I don't just talk about AI — I'm obsessed with it. I run my entire operation on AI agents. I speak the language of both startups and venture capital, which is rarer than people think.

I'm also a bridge between two markets. German-born, built companies in Munich, now in New York. European and international founders don't have many investors who understand both sides. I do, and they know it.

I also see a gap in the market that aligns with HOF's thesis: nobody is doing vertical AI at seed in NYC. Generalist funds everywhere, a few doing horizontal AI infrastructure, but almost none focused on AI for specific industries. That will change fast, and I want to be part of making it happen.

Happy to share my CV or jump on a call whenever works for you.
