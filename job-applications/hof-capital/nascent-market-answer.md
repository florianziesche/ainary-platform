# HOF Capital — Nascent Market Opportunity Answer

## Final Version v2 (Feb 9, 2026)

**The Agent Economy Infrastructure**

Everyone is racing to build bigger language models. I think the real opportunity is one layer above: infrastructure for AI agents that act as economic participants.

This is already happening. Google shipped its Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) in September 2025. Anthropic's MCP and the A2A Protocol let agents talk to each other across platforms. The Linux Foundation started the Agentic AI Foundation. McKinsey puts agent-driven commerce at up to $5 trillion by 2030.

At the same time, building software costs almost nothing now (Lovable, Bolt, Cursor), open-source models run on consumer hardware, and agents are getting good enough to negotiate and transact on their own.

I see this daily. I run an AI agent on my MacBook Air for under $200/month. It manages my job applications, writes and publishes content, runs research, coordinates across Telegram, email, and web. It works today. Primitively. And it keeps hitting the same walls: no memory between sessions, can't pay for anything, no way to verify trust with other agents, no real understanding of consequences.

Each of those walls is a startup. The first three (memory, payments, trust) are buildable now. The fourth, consequence understanding, is where world models come in. LeCun has been saying for two years that LLMs won't get us to AGI and that world models will be the dominant architecture within five years. DeepMind, World Labs, and Meta are all building toward this. When agents get world models, they stop being fancy autocomplete and start being real economic actors.

The opportunity: the platform layer where these agents discover services, negotiate, build trust, and settle payments. The protocols (MCP, A2A, AP2) are being written right now. This is where the internet was in 1995. TCP/IP exists. The platform on top doesn't.

It's a $1T+ opportunity because it doesn't replace one industry. It adds a new participant to all of them.
