## Version v3 (Feb 9, 2026)

**The Agent Economy Infrastructure**

Everyone is racing to build bigger language models. The real opportunity is one layer above: infrastructure for AI agents that act as economic participants.

The foundation is being laid right now. Google shipped its Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) in September 2025. Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A Protocol let agents communicate across platforms. The Linux Foundation launched the Agentic AI Foundation. McKinsey estimates agent-driven commerce at up to $5 trillion by 2030.

Three forces are accelerating this. Software creation costs have collapsed (Lovable, Bolt, Cursor). Open-source models run on consumer hardware. And agents are crossing the threshold from assistants to autonomous actors. Bessemer calls vertical AI a 10x larger opportunity than vertical SaaS because it taps the 13% of GDP spent on labor, not the 1% spent on IT.

I've been stress-testing these systems as an operator: running multi-agent architectures that manage persistent context, coordinate across APIs, and execute real workflows end-to-end. The infrastructure breaks in four predictable places: memory degrades across sessions, agents can't transact, there's no trust verification between agents from different principals, and they lack causal reasoning to handle consequences.

Each of those is a venture-scale company. Memory is the most active space right now — Letta, Zep's temporal knowledge graphs, and the ICLR 2026 MemAgents workshop all signal how urgent this problem is. Payments infrastructure has Google's AP2 as a first attempt but nothing resembling a standard. Trust and identity for agents is wide open — Saviynt's recent raise shows the market recognizes this. The fourth layer, consequence understanding, is where world models come in. LeCun has argued for two years that LLMs alone won't get us there. DeepMind, World Labs, and Meta are all building toward causal world models. When agents get those, they stop being sophisticated autocomplete and become real economic actors.

The investment opportunity is the platform layer: where agents discover services, negotiate terms, build trust, and settle payments. The protocols are being written now. This is where the internet was in 1995. TCP/IP existed but the platforms on top didn't.

It's a $1T+ opportunity because it doesn't replace one industry. It adds a new participant to all of them.

## Option 2 — Sharp & Short

**The Agent Economy Infrastructure**

Everyone is building bigger AI models. The real opportunity is one layer above: the infrastructure for AI agents that participate in the economy. Google, Anthropic, and the Linux Foundation are already shipping the protocols. McKinsey puts the market at $5 trillion by 2030. Bessemer calls it 10x bigger than SaaS because it replaces labor spend, not software spend.

I work with these systems daily. They break in four places: agents forget everything between sessions, they can't pay for anything, they can't verify who they're dealing with, and they don't understand consequences. Each of those gaps is a company waiting to be built.

The first three are solvable now. The fourth requires world models, the ability to simulate cause and effect before acting. DeepMind, Meta, and World Labs are all racing toward this. When agents get it, they go from tools to autonomous participants.

The opportunity is the platform layer where agents find services, negotiate, build trust, and settle payments. The protocols exist. The platform doesn't. This is the internet in 1995.

It's $1T+ because it doesn't replace one industry. It adds a new participant to all of them.

## HR/Partner Review

**HR:** "Klar, strukturiert, kein Bullshit. Weiterleiten an Partner." ✅

**Partner:**
- "Gutes Framework. 4 Gaps zeigt strukturiertes Denken."
- "McKinsey + Bessemer — kennt die Quellen."
- **Aber:** "Jeder sagt 'I work with these systems daily.' Was genau? Was siehst du das andere nicht sehen?"
- **Und:** "$1T+" am Ende ist bold. McKinsey sagt $5T commerce, aber der Sprung zu "$1T+ investment opportunity" ist nicht erklärt.

**Was stark ist:**
- Framing: "everyone builds models, opportunity is above"
- "The protocols exist. The platform doesn't." — bleibt hängen
- 4 Gaps als Framework

**Optionale Fixes:**
1. Intro-Satz ("Agent Economy Infrastructure is an obvious...") klingt wie eine Überschrift im Text. Entweder als Titel ÜBER den Text, oder streichen. "Everyone is building bigger AI models" ist der stärkere Einstieg.
2. "I work with these systems daily" — konkreter: *"I work with these systems daily — running multi-agent workflows across real tools and APIs."*
