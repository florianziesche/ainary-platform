**Role:** Associate (if open) or Speculative Application
**Status:** DRAFT — needs research on current openings

---

Dear HOF Capital Team,

I'm reaching out because HOF Capital's focus on AI/ML and deep tech aligns precisely with my background and investment interests.

## Why I'm Writing

As a former startup CEO who spent 5 years building AI products and raising venture capital, I understand both sides of the table. I'm now transitioning to venture capital, specifically targeting funds with deep technical focus and operator-friendly cultures.

## Relevant Experience

**As Founder/CEO of 36ZERO Vision (2019-2024):**
- Raised €5.0M across multiple rounds (€3.5M equity, €1.5M grants)
- Built cloud-based computer vision platform for industrial quality inspection
- Shipped to 15+ enterprise customers
- Led technical and commercial strategy

**Current Technical Work:**
- Building AI systems with <0.2% hallucination rates (multi-agent RAG architecture)
- Developing AI-native manufacturing software (CNC Planner)
- Deep hands-on experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, and production AI systems

## What I Bring

1. **Operator Credibility:** I've been in founders' shoes — fundraising, building product, managing teams
2. **Technical Depth:** Hands-on AI/ML experience, not just surface-level understanding
3. **Deal Flow Potential:** Network of 200+ founders from fundraising advisory work
4. **Thesis Alignment:** Focused on AI-native vertical software — same space as many HOF portfolio companies

## Why HOF Capital

Your explicit focus on founders with AI/ML and technical backgrounds resonates with me. I've followed your investments in [specific portfolio companies — research needed] and see strong alignment with my thesis on AI-native vertical software.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background could contribute to HOF Capital's deal sourcing and portfolio support.

Best regards,
Florian Ziesche
