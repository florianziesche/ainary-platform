## 📝 Cover Letter Hooks (Fund-Specific)

### For Lux Capital:
```
You invested in Scale AI when everyone else was building AutoML tools.
You saw that data infrastructure beats model optimization.

I've spent 5 years on the other side: building AI systems that need Scale.

Now I want to help you find the next Scales – the unsexy infrastructure that makes AI actually work.
```

### For Gradient Ventures (Google):
```
Google invented Transformers. I built systems on top of them.

Legal AI: 0.2% hallucination rate (vs. 5% industry standard)
Multi-agent verification: what LLMs need to be production-ready

I can evaluate AI startups on what matters: architecture, not hype.
```

### For Two Sigma Ventures:
```
You're quantitative. I'm technical. We speak the same language.

Most AI investors ask "Is this a good demo?"
I ask "Does this scale? What's the error bound? How do you verify?"

5 years building production AI systems. Now I want to find them at Seed.
```
