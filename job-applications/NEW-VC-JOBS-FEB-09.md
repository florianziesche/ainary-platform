## Lead #1: Equal Ventures — Manager Position

**Fund:** Equal Ventures
**Location:** New York
**Role:** Manager (likely Associate-level based on typical VC hierarchy)
**Posted:** January 11, 2026
**Source:** Startup&VC
**Apply:** https://www.startupandvc.com/venture-capital-jobs

- Notable: "Equal" positioning suggests diversity/inclusion focus
- Size: Emerging manager (likely Fund I or II)

### Why Good Fit:

- Emerging manager = higher chance of meaningful role

### Application Strategy:

- Angle: "I've been on the other side of your diligence calls — I know what technical founders need"

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Lead #2: Plug and Play — Manager (AI/Deep Tech Vertical)

**Fund:** Plug and Play Tech Center
**Location:** Sunnyvale, CA (but has NYC office + global)
**Role:** Manager
**Posted:** January 11, 2026
**Source:** Startup&VC

### About Plug and Play:
- Corporate VC / accelerator hybrid
- Verticals: Fintech, Health, Mobility, Supply Chain, **AI**
- Stage: Pre-seed to Series A
- Model: Accelerator batches + direct investment
- Portfolio: PayPal, Dropbox, Guardant Health (strong exits)

### Why Interesting (with caveats):
✅ Strong AI vertical program
✅ Global platform = resources
✅ Deal flow volume = learning opportunity
⚠️ West Coast location (but remote possible?)
⚠️ Corporate VC model = different from pure VC

### Application Strategy:
- Angle: AI expertise + European network (Plug and Play has Berlin office)
- Position as bridge between US and European AI ecosystems
- Emphasize: Can source + evaluate technical AI companies

**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ (location dependent)

## Lead #3: Struck Capital — Internship/Junior Role

**Fund:** Struck Capital
**Location:** Los Angeles, CA
**Role:** Internship (but often converts to full-time)
**Posted:** January 11, 2026
**Source:** Startup&VC

### About Struck Capital:
- Stage: Pre-seed to Series A
- Focus: Consumer, marketplace, SaaS
- Notable: Founded by former Upfront Ventures team
- Size: $85M Fund II (2021) — emerging manager

### Why Consider (despite internship label):
- Emerging managers often hire "interns" but give full associate-level work
- LA = less competitive than SF/NYC for VC roles
- Consumer/marketplace = different angle from pure AI (diversification)
- Strong brand in LA ecosystem

### Concerns:
⚠️ "Internship" label = likely lower comp
⚠️ LA location = not ideal for Florian's NYC preference
⚠️ Consumer focus ≠ Florian's AI/deep tech thesis

**Priority:** ⭐⭐ (backup option)

**Fund:** Initio Capital
**Location:** Hybrid (New York, NY)

- Locations: Global (London, SF, Singapore, Paris, Berlin)

### Why Interesting (non-traditional VC path):
✅ AI/ML portfolio strength
✅ Pre-seed = earliest stage possible
✅ Global = European angle
✅ "Ops Associate" = potentially investor-track role
⚠️ SF location

## Key Insights from Research

### What's Working in the Market:
- **Hybrid/Remote:** Many funds now open to remote start, especially for technical diligence roles
- **Flexible Structures:** "Part-time" and "Contract" options emerging (Initio example) = could fit Florian's situation
- **AI Focus:** Every major fund now has "AI vertical" or "AI specialist" role
- **Emerging Managers:** Strong hiring (Equal, Struck, others) = higher acceptance rate

### Competition Analysis:
- 585 VC jobs in NYC (Glassdoor) but only ~104 analyst-level
- Most applicants: MBB consultants, investment bankers, generic MBAs
- Florian's Edge: **Technical founder background + production AI systems + European network**
- Differentiation: "I don't just evaluate AI companies — I build AI systems that ship to production"

### Salary Expectations (Based on Research):
- **Analyst:** $67K-$100K (ZipRecruiter data)
- **Associate:** $85K-$175K (Indeed/Glassdoor range)
- **Emerging Manager Funds:** Typically lower base ($80-100K) but higher carry potential
- **Established Funds:** Higher base ($120-150K) but lower carry %

### Geography Strategy:
- **NYC (Priority 1):** Initio, Equal Ventures, + 15 other funds to research
- **Remote-Friendly (Priority 2):** Plug and Play, EF (if investor-track)
- **West Coast (Backup):** Only if exceptional fit (Conviction, a16z, etc.)

## ROI Calculation

**If 10 applications → 3 interviews → 1 offer:**
- Base salary: $100K (conservative for associate)
- Carry: 0.5-1% of $50M fund = $250K-500K on successful exit (5-7 year horizon)
- Learning value: Priceless (see 100+ deals/year, build VC network)
- Opportunity cost vs. freelancing: Break-even at $8.3K/month = achievable

**Time investment:**
- Research (this session): 1.5 hours
- Application prep: ~3 hours per high-quality application
- Interviews: ~10 hours (if 3 funds, 3-4 rounds each)
- Total: ~23 hours for 1 offer = $4,348/hour (based on $100K salary)
