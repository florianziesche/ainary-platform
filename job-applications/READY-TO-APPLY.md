### Cover Letter Draft:

```
Subject: VC Analyst Application — AI Builder Transitioning to VC

Dear HOF Capital Investment Team,

Your requirement for AI or SWE experience is exactly why I'm reaching out. I don't just evaluate AI companies — I build production AI systems.

Background:
• 5 years as startup CEO, raised €5.5M across equity and grants
• Built a legal AI platform achieving <0.2% hallucination rate using multi-agent verification architecture (BM25 + semantic retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, 4-agent verification pipeline)
• MD/COO at 36ZERO Vision, a cloud computer vision SaaS company in Munich
• Currently building CNC manufacturing AI and advising European startups on AI implementation

What I bring to HOF Capital:
1. Technical depth to evaluate AI/deep tech investments — I can read code, assess architectures, and pressure-test technical claims
2. Operator perspective on what separates "cool demo" from "production system" — critical for early-stage AI diligence
3. Fundraising experience from both sides of the table — raised capital as a founder, now ready to deploy it
4. Global network across NYC and European AI/startup ecosystems

I'm particularly drawn to HOF Capital's conviction in generational companies. Your portfolio (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) shows you identify paradigm-shifting AI companies early. My daily practice building AI systems gives me the technical intuition to help you continue doing so.

I'm based in NYC and available for an in-person conversation at your Bond Street office.

### Prep Notes:
- Research portfolio companies deeper (especially recent investments)
- Prepare a "deal memo" on a recent AI company as writing sample
- Study HOF Capital's investment thesis / blog posts

## 🔥 Priority 2: Betaworks — Investment Associate

**Role:** Investment Associate
**Location:** NYC
**Salary:** $85,000 - $125,000
**Apply:** https://www.vcplatform.com/jobs (Betaworks listing)
**Also note:** Betaworks Spring '26 AI Camp (Agent Systems) — Mar 2 - May 15 in NYC

### Why Great Fit:
- Seed-stage, NYC-based — Florian's target
- Focus: AI, consumer tech, dev tools
- Portfolio: HuggingFace, Kickstarter, Tumblr, Giphy
- "Product-focused" requirement aligns with builder background
- AI Camp running on "Agent Systems" — literally what Florian builds daily

### Cover Letter Draft:

```
Subject: Investment Associate — Builder Who Lives Agent Systems Daily

Hi Betaworks team,

I saw your Agent Systems Camp announcement and thought: "I'm literally building this right now."

My daily workflow involves multi-agent AI systems with autonomous planning, memory management, and proactive execution — the exact thesis of your Spring '26 Camp. I don't just invest in these ideas; I ship them.

Background:
• 5 years startup CEO (€5.5M raised), built AI products from zero to production
• Currently running multi-agent systems daily: legal AI with <0.2% hallucination rate, manufacturing AI for CNC production, and an AI orchestration layer that manages my workflow
• MD/COO at 36ZERO Vision (cloud computer vision SaaS)

What makes me different from typical associate candidates:
• I can evaluate AI founders technically — architecture, scaling challenges, data moats
• I understand "demo to production" gaps firsthand — the biggest risk in AI investing
• I build in public — shipping AI tools, writing about the process, engaging the community

Betaworks' approach of building and investing resonates deeply. You don't just write checks — you build companies. That's exactly the kind of VC I want to be.

I'm NYC-based and would love to discuss how my builder background can strengthen Betaworks' AI thesis.

### Prep Notes:
- Deep-dive Betaworks portfolio companies
- Prepare thoughts on 2-3 agent system startup ideas
- Reference AI Camp themes in application

## 🔥 Priority 3: Leonis Capital — Associate (Partner-Track)

**Role:** Associate — AI Startup Evaluation, Research, Investment Analysis
**Location:** Remote (research-driven firm)
**Apply:** https://www.vcstack.com/job (Leonis listing)

### Why Strong Fit:
- "Research-driven, conviction-led" — matches Florian's analytical style
- Focus: AI-native companies, technical founders
- "The Leonis AI 100" research — values deep research capabilities
- Partner-track = long-term growth
- "First partner for technical founders" — Florian IS a technical founder

### Cover Letter Draft:

```
Subject: Associate Application — Technical Founder Ready to Back the Next Wave

Dear Leonis Capital team,

"The first partner for technical founders" — that line resonated because I've been on the other side. As a technical founder who raised €5.5M and built production AI systems, I know what early-stage technical founders actually need from their first investor.

Why I want to join Leonis specifically:
• Your research-heavy approach mirrors how I work — I build conviction through deep technical understanding, not pattern matching
• The Leonis AI 100 demonstrates the kind of systematic market mapping I do naturally
• AI-native focus aligns with my daily practice building production AI systems

What I'd contribute:
1. Technical diligence depth — I can evaluate AI architectures, assess data moats, and identify the difference between a wrapper and a platform
2. Research capabilities — systematic, source-cited, signal-over-noise (built knowledge systems processing 100+ AI research sources)
3. Founder empathy — I've been in the trenches with fundraising, hiring, pivoting. I know what support founders actually value vs. what VCs think they want
4. Production AI experience — legal AI (<0.2% hallucination), computer vision SaaS, manufacturing AI

I'd love to discuss how my operator-researcher hybrid profile fits your team.

## 🟡 Priority 4: Point72 Ventures — Ventures Associate, AI Investing

**Role:** Ventures Associate, AI Investing (2-year program)
**Location:** NYC / San Francisco
**Salary:** $90,000 - $130,000+ total comp
**Apply:** https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/p72pi/jobs/7866728002 (may need to check if still active)

### Why Interesting:
- Dedicated AI investing team
- Steve Cohen's platform — massive resources
- 2-year program = structured entry
- Hybrid VC + hedge fund = unique perspective

### Cover Letter Draft:

```
Subject: Ventures Associate, AI Investing — Operator with Production AI Experience

Dear Point72 Ventures AI Team,

I'm applying because I bring something rare to AI investing: I've actually built production AI systems that work at enterprise scale.

Most AI due diligence asks "does the demo work?" My experience lets me ask harder questions: "Will this architecture scale? Is the data moat real? Can this team ship production code?"

Key qualifications:
• Built legal AI with <0.2% hallucination rate — multi-agent verification architecture
• 5 years as CEO, raised €5.5M, built products from zero to revenue
• Deep technical expertise: LLMs, RAG systems, multi-agent architectures, AI governance
• Unique position spanning NYC and European AI ecosystems

I'm drawn to Point72 Ventures' data-driven approach and the depth of resources your platform provides. The 2-year program structure appeals to me as someone who wants to learn the investing craft while contributing technical expertise from day one.

## 🟡 Priority 5: Conviction (Sarah Guo) — Speculative Outreach

**Note:** No open associate posting found. But Conviction is THE AI-native fund.
**Strategy:** Warm outreach, not cold application
**Apply to:** jobs@conviction.com (from Sarah Guo's LinkedIn post)

### Approach:
1. Follow Sarah Guo on Twitter + LinkedIn
2. Engage authentically with content
3. Leverage VC Lab network for warm intro
4. Send speculative email after building visibility

### Speculative Email Draft:

```
Subject: AI Operator Building in Public — Would Love to Learn from Conviction

Hi Sarah,

I've been following Conviction's thesis on AI-native companies, and your background resonates — you were an operator before an investor, and it shows in how you think about AI companies.

I'm in a similar transition. After 5 years as a startup CEO (€5.5M raised, production AI systems), I'm moving to the investing side. Currently in the VC Lab program, building my thesis around AI-native infrastructure.

I'm not writing to ask for a job — I'm writing because I'd value 15 minutes of your perspective on:
• How you evaluate AI companies differently given your operator background
• What signals separate "AI wrapper" from "AI-native" at the seed stage

Either way, I'm learning a lot from your content. Keep pushing the space forward.
