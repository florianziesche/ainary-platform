Dear Decile Capital Team,

I'm applying for the Resident position supporting Decile Capital's fundraising and operations. As a current VC Lab participant and former startup CEO who raised over €5.5 million, I bring hands-on fundraising experience from both sides of the table.

**Fundraising Results at 36ZERO Vision (2020-2024):**

As CEO and co-founder of 36ZERO Vision, a cloud-based computer vision SaaS startup in Munich, I led all fundraising efforts:

- **2021:** Closed €3M VC round plus €135K in angel investments (3 angels at €35K, €50K, and €50K)
- **2023:** Secured €1M follow-on VC round during challenging market conditions
- **Grants:** Won €1.5M+ in non-dilutive funding (ZIM and Forschungszulage — competitive German R&D programs)
- **Total raised:** €5.0M+ (€3.5M equity, €1.5M+ grants)

Beyond closing rounds, I managed the full fundraising lifecycle: LP/investor research, pipeline tracking, due diligence preparation, and follow-up sequences. I know what it takes to move investors from first meeting to wire transfer.

**Why Decile Capital:**

I'm building toward a career in venture capital, and Decile's mission to democratize VC resonates deeply. VC Lab has already sharpened my thinking on fund construction and manager selection. The opportunity to support Decile Capital's emerging manager strategy — while gaining operational exposure to fundraising at scale — is exactly the hands-on experience I'm seeking.

**What I bring:**

- **Operator credibility:** I've been in founders' shoes, navigating fundraising while building product and team
- **LP perspective:** Having pitched 50+ investors, I understand what makes diligence materials compelling
- **AI-native workflow:** I use AI tools extensively for research, pipeline management, and content creation — aligned with Decile Hub's vision
- **Execution focus:** I thrive in high-ownership roles where results matter more than titles

I'm based in NYC and available to start immediately. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my fundraising experience can support Decile Capital's growth.

Best regards,  
Florian Ziesche
