## 1. Lionheart Ventures — Associate/Principal, AI Fund

**Subject: Associate/Principal Application — Building AI That Preserves Human Agency**

Dear Lionheart Ventures team,

Your thesis around "the wise development of transformative technologies" isn't just investment framing — it's a design philosophy I've been building toward for years.

When I built a production RAG system achieving <0.2% hallucination rates, the goal wasn't just technical performance. It was ensuring AI delivers trustworthy outputs that humans can rely on and verify — the same conviction that underlies your investments in Anthropic's safety-first approach, Goodfire's interpretability tools, and Gray Swan's AI safety and security testing. I believe the companies that win the next decade will be those that build AI systems humans can understand, audit, and trust. Your portfolio reflects exactly that belief.

**What I bring to Lionheart:**

I've lived the AI stack from production to cap table. As CEO/Founder at 36ZERO Vision, I built a cloud computer vision SaaS platform and sold it to enterprise clients — BMW, Siemens, Bosch. I raised €5.0M+ across equity and grants and learned the hard way what separates AI demos from AI products. The gap is reliability, governance, and human oversight — precisely where your thesis sits.

Today, I build multi-agent AI architectures daily. My GitHub (github.com/fziescheus-alt) shows this in practice: **Exec-Research-Factory** is a multi-agent research pipeline with autonomous planning and verification; **CNC_Planner_PRO** applies AI to complex manufacturing workflows where errors have real-world consequences; **llm-guide** documents production patterns for reliable AI deployment. These aren't weekend projects — they're working systems that reflect my conviction that AI must be built carefully.

I'm also building Ainary Ventures through VC Lab (Decile Group), developing an investment thesis around AI infrastructure. This means I don't just evaluate AI companies — I actively build the frameworks for understanding what makes them durable.

**Why Lionheart specifically:** You're the rare fund where evaluating Softmax's compute optimization or Piramidal's AI architecture requires genuine technical depth. I can read codebases, assess model architectures, and distinguish frontier research from marketing — while connecting it to the human agency thesis that makes your fund differentiated.

My M.Sc. and B.Sc. from TUM (Corporate Finance + Data Science/ML) give me the dual lens to evaluate both the technology and the business model.

I'm NYC-based and would welcome a conversation about how my builder-operator perspective fits your team.

## 2. Point72 Ventures — AI Investing Associate (NYC/Stamford)

**Subject: AI Investing Associate Application — Operator Who Speaks Both Code and Cap Tables**

Dear Point72 Ventures team,

Point72 Ventures occupies a unique position in venture — a firm backed by Steven A. Cohen's decades of data-driven public markets experience, applying that rigor to early-stage AI and enterprise investing. That combination of quantitative discipline and venture conviction is exactly where I operate best.

Your portfolio of 130+ investments spanning fintech, AI, and deep tech — from Adonis in healthcare AI to Apex in space manufacturing to Anvilogic in cybersecurity — shows a fund that invests across the AI application layer, not just in models. That pattern recognition across industries is what I'd bring from the operator side.

**My background:**

5 years as CEO/Founder at 36ZERO Vision, a cloud computer vision SaaS company serving BMW, Siemens, and Bosch. I raised €5.0M+, built engineering teams, negotiated enterprise contracts, and learned the precise gap between technical capability and product-market fit. As MD/COO, I owned the P&L and operations — the kind of data-driven execution Point72 values.

Today, I build production AI systems daily. My GitHub (github.com/fziescheus-alt) demonstrates this: **research-system** is a multi-agent architecture for autonomous research with planning and verification layers; **CNC_Planner_PRO** applies LLM reasoning to manufacturing process optimization; **task-management** shows how I build AI-native workflow systems. I write code, deploy models, and stress-test architectures — I don't just evaluate pitch decks.

**What I'd bring to P72V:**

1. **Technical sourcing edge** — I can identify breakout AI companies before they hit the mainstream VC radar because I understand the technology at the architecture level
2. **Enterprise sales lens** — Having sold AI to BMW and Siemens, I can evaluate whether a startup's enterprise motion is real or aspirational
3. **Quantitative rigor** — My TUM education (Corporate Finance + Data Science/ML) means I model companies with the same discipline your parent firm applies to public markets
4. **Founder network** — Building Ainary Ventures through VC Lab (Decile Group) has embedded me in the early-stage AI founder ecosystem

Point72's bridge between public market data sophistication and venture investing is a model I deeply respect. I'd love to bring my operator-builder perspective to your AI investing practice.

## 3. Alumni Ventures — Venture Associate

**Subject: Venture Associate Application — AI Operator With Co-Investment Pattern Recognition**

Dear Alumni Ventures team,

Alumni Ventures has built something remarkable — $1B+ AUM, ~1,300 portfolio companies, and dedicated AI-focused funds that co-invest alongside tier-one firms. That scale creates a unique advantage: the ability to see deal flow patterns across the entire AI landscape, from seed through Series B follow-ons. I want to help sharpen that edge.

Your AI & Robotics Fund and AI First Fund sit at the intersection of where I've spent the last seven years: building, deploying, and evaluating AI systems in production environments.

**My background:**

As CEO/Founder of 36ZERO Vision, I built a cloud computer vision SaaS company from zero to enterprise clients (BMW, Siemens, Bosch), raising €5.0M+ across equity and grants. I know what separates AI companies that scale from those that stall — it's not the model, it's the data flywheel, the integration layer, and the go-to-market motion.

I build AI systems daily. My GitHub (github.com/fziescheus-alt) is my portfolio: **Exec-Research-Factory** automates complex research workflows using multi-agent coordination — the kind of agentic AI your portfolio companies are building; **CNC_Planner_PRO** applies AI to manufacturing, demonstrating vertical AI applications; **llm-guide** is a practitioner's guide to production LLM patterns I've battle-tested. These show I evaluate AI from the inside out.

**What I'd bring to Alumni Ventures:**

1. **AI deal evaluation at scale** — With 500+ deals flowing through your teams monthly, you need associates who can quickly separate signal from noise in AI. I can read architectures, assess technical moats, and benchmark against the production systems I build
2. **Co-investment pattern recognition** — Your model of co-investing alongside elite firms means understanding what a16z, Sequoia, or Lightspeed see in a deal. My VC Lab experience (building Ainary Ventures through Decile Group) gives me that investor-side lens
3. **Cross-sector AI expertise** — My background spans computer vision (36ZERO), manufacturing AI (CNC_Planner_PRO), and knowledge systems (research-system). I can evaluate AI companies across the sectors your fund covers: HealthTech, FinTech, ClimateTech, and beyond
4. **Dual education** — M.Sc. and B.Sc. from TUM in Corporate Finance and Data Science/ML — purpose-built for evaluating AI companies

I'm excited by Alumni Ventures' mission to democratize venture access while maintaining institutional-grade AI investing. I'd love to discuss how my technical-operator background fits your team.

## 4. Bain Capital Ventures — Investment Associate, Application Software

**Subject: Investment Associate Application — From Building Enterprise Software to Investing in It**

Dear Bain Capital Ventures team,

BCV's recent insight on 2025 AI trends captured something I've observed firsthand: the gap between AI hype and enterprise adoption is where the real opportunities live. When Abby Meyers describes investing in growth-stage AI and application software, and Rak Garg highlights companies like Decagon and Cognition posting extraordinary growth — I see a fund that understands the difference between AI demos and AI products. That distinction is my entire career.

**BCV values operators. I am one.**

As CEO/Founder of 36ZERO Vision, I built a cloud computer vision SaaS platform and brought it to production with BMW, Siemens, and Bosch. Raising €5.0M+, managing engineering teams, negotiating enterprise contracts, pivoting when the market demanded it — I've lived every stage of the application software journey BCV invests in.

As MD/COO, I owned operations, revenue, and product simultaneously. I know what a company's org chart, burn rate, and customer retention metrics actually mean, because I've been responsible for all three.

**My technical edge:**

I don't just evaluate software companies — I build software. My GitHub (github.com/fziescheus-alt) demonstrates active, production-quality work: **Exec-Research-Factory** is a multi-agent research system with planning, execution, and verification layers — the exact agentic AI pattern your portfolio company Cognition is commercializing. **CNC_Planner_PRO** is vertical application software for manufacturing. **research-system** shows how I architect reliable AI pipelines.

I built a production RAG system achieving <0.2% hallucination rates using hybrid retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, and 4-agent verification. That's the kind of technical depth that lets me evaluate whether a SaaS company's AI features are structural advantages or marketing features.

**What I'd bring to BCV:**

- **Application software intuition** — I've built, sold, and scaled B2B SaaS. I can assess product-market fit, pricing power, and expansion revenue from the operator's seat
- **AI architecture fluency** — I can evaluate technical moats, data flywheels, and model strategies in minutes, not weeks
- **Founder empathy** — When a portfolio company CEO calls with a problem, I've been in their exact position
- **Dual TUM education** (Corporate Finance + Data Science/ML) for rigorous financial and technical analysis

BCV's combination of Bain's analytical rigor with genuine respect for operators makes it the fund I'd be most excited to join. I'm NYC-based and ready to contribute.

## 5. Equal Ventures — Principal (NYC)

**Subject: Principal Application — Thesis-Driven Investing Meets Operator Depth**

Dear Rick, Richard, and the Equal Ventures team,

Equal Ventures' approach is rare and deliberate: thesis-driven, concentrated bets in legacy industries — climate/energy, insurance, retail, supply chain — with deep sector research before writing a single check. Your conviction that "concentration favors diversification" and your willingness to publicly share failures alongside wins tell me this is a fund that operates with intellectual honesty. That's the fund I want to be part of.

**Why I fit Equal's model:**

Your "prepared mind" framework — exhaustive research, validation with market experts, then conviction-driven investment — mirrors how I've operated my entire career. At 36ZERO Vision, I didn't build a generic AI company. I built cloud computer vision for specific industrial applications (BMW, Siemens, Bosch), going deep into manufacturing workflows before writing a line of code. That vertical discipline is Equal's DNA.

I raised €5.0M+ as CEO/Founder, then served as MD/COO owning operations and revenue. I know what it takes to disrupt legacy industries from the inside — the sales cycles are longer, the integration is harder, and the moats are deeper. That's exactly where Equal invests.

**How I'd contribute to Equal's thesis work:**

Your sectors — supply chain, insurance, retail, climate — are being transformed by AI in ways that require technical understanding to evaluate. My GitHub (github.com/fziescheus-alt) shows what I build daily: **CNC_Planner_PRO** applies AI to manufacturing process optimization, the exact kind of vertical software that transforms legacy industries; **Exec-Research-Factory** is a multi-agent research system I use to conduct the deep market analysis Equal's process demands; **research-system** shows my approach to rigorous, structured investigation.

I'm also building Ainary Ventures through VC Lab (Decile Group), developing investment theses from first principles — the same research-first methodology Equal champions.

**The operator advantage:**

At Principal level, Equal needs someone who can lead deals, work closely with founders post-investment, and develop new thesis areas. I've been on the other side of every board meeting, every pivot conversation, every "we need to extend runway" discussion. I bring founder credibility that opens doors and keeps them open.

My M.Sc. and B.Sc. from TUM (Corporate Finance + Data Science/ML) ground my analysis in both financial rigor and technical depth.

Equal Ventures is building the fund I wish existed when I was a founder. I'd love to help build it from the inside.

## 6. Comcast Ventures — Associate (NYC)

**Subject: Associate Application — Where Enterprise AI Meets Media at Scale**

Dear Comcast Ventures team,

Your recent investments tell a clear story: Comcast Ventures is positioning at the intersection of AI, media, and enterprise infrastructure. Creatify's AI video generation for advertising creative, Moonvalley's licensed-data video model, and the Universal Ads AI-powered video generator — these aren't isolated bets. They're a thesis: AI will reshape how content is created, distributed, and monetized, and Comcast NBCUniversal's scale is the strategic edge that makes these portfolio companies win.

That thesis is exactly where my experience lives.

**My background:**

At 36ZERO Vision, I built a cloud computer vision SaaS platform — literally AI that processes and understands visual media. Our enterprise clients (BMW, Siemens, Bosch) used our technology to analyze visual data at scale. I raised €5.0M+, built the engineering team, and learned that AI companies win or lose based on their access to data, distribution, and enterprise relationships — exactly the strategic assets Comcast brings to portfolio companies.

As MD/COO, I owned the full stack: product, operations, revenue. I understand both the technology and the business model of companies like Creatify and Moonvalley, because I've built in that same AI-meets-media space.

**What I bring to Comcast Ventures:**

1. **Computer vision expertise** — My background is literally in AI video/image processing. I can evaluate generative media companies with the technical depth your portfolio demands
2. **Enterprise sales perspective** — I've sold AI to the world's largest companies. I know what "leveraging Comcast NBCUniversal's scale" actually looks like in practice for a portfolio company
3. **Active AI builder** — My GitHub (github.com/fziescheus-alt) shows daily production work: **Exec-Research-Factory** (multi-agent AI systems), **CNC_Planner_PRO** (vertical AI applications), **llm-guide** (production LLM deployment patterns)
4. **Strategic investing lens** — Building Ainary Ventures through VC Lab taught me to evaluate not just the technology, but the strategic fit — the same lens a CVC like Comcast Ventures needs

**The CVC advantage matters to me:**

I chose to apply to Comcast Ventures specifically because CVCs with genuine strategic assets outperform in sectors where distribution and data access define winners. Your portfolio companies don't just get capital — they get Comcast's content pipeline, NBCUniversal's creator network, and Xfinity's distribution reach.

I'm NYC-based, deeply technical, and passionate about the AI-media convergence your fund is leading.

## 7. Techstars NYC — Business Associate

**Subject: Business Associate Application — Founder Who Builds Founders**

Dear Techstars NYC team,

Techstars has produced 16 unicorns, invested in 4,000+ companies, and proven that the accelerator model — intense mentorship, structured sprints, and network access — is the highest-leverage way to build early-stage companies. I want to be on the operating side of that machine.

Your NYC program backs founders across FinTech, Enterprise SaaS, Health & Wellness, and PropTech — sectors where New York's enterprise buyers, financial institutions, and healthcare systems create natural distribution advantages. Having sold AI to enterprises myself, I know how powerful those local networks are for early-stage companies.

**Why I'm the right Business Associate:**

I've been a Techstars founder in spirit. At 36ZERO Vision, I lived the 13-week sprint lifecycle on repeat — building MVPs, iterating with customers, pitching investors, and making existential decisions weekly. I raised €5.0M+ and served enterprise clients (BMW, Siemens, Bosch). I've been on the other side of every conversation a Techstars mentor has with a founder.

But what makes me different is that I still build. My GitHub (github.com/fziescheus-alt) is active daily: **CNC_Planner_PRO** is a production AI application for manufacturing — the kind of vertical SaaS a Techstars cohort company might build; **Exec-Research-Factory** shows multi-agent AI system design; **task-management** demonstrates how I structure complex operations. When a founder asks "how should I architect this?" I don't give theoretical answers — I show them working code.

**What I'd bring to Techstars NYC:**

1. **Mentor credibility** — Founders trust people who've done it. I've raised capital, built products, hired and fired, pivoted, and survived. That authenticity makes mentorship real, not performative
2. **Technical depth** — In an AI-first cohort, you need someone who can evaluate architectures, spot technical risk, and help founders make build-vs-buy decisions. I do this daily
3. **Cohort acceleration** — My operator instinct is "how do we ship this week?" — the exact energy a 13-week program demands
4. **VC network building** — I'm building Ainary Ventures through VC Lab (Decile Group), which means I'm actively connected to the investor ecosystem that Techstars companies need for follow-on funding

**The Techstars model resonates personally:**

SendGrid, ClassPass, Chainalysis — these started as scrappy teams in an accelerator and became defining companies. The Business Associate role is where I can combine my operator experience, technical skills, and investor perspective to help the next cohort do the same.

NYC-based, ready to start, and excited about the intensity.
