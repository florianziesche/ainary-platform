Dear Betaworks Team,

Your Spring 2026 Camp theme—Agent Systems—is exactly the technical frontier I've been building on. I recently architected a Legal AI platform using multi-agent RAG that achieved <0.2\% hallucination rate, which required solving precisely the challenges your Camp cohort companies will face: reliable agent orchestration, grounded retrieval, and production-grade agentic workflows that professionals actually trust.

Before that, I built and scaled an AI SaaS company to BMW, Siemens, and Bosch — raising \texteuro5.0M+ as CEO and later MD/COO at 36ZERO Vision. I managed P\&L in a 150-person organization and drove product from technical discovery through enterprise deployment.

What I'd bring to Betaworks: an operator who's built AI products in both vision and language, and can do genuine technical diligence on agentic systems — not just ask about TAM. I've shipped multi-agent architectures, production RAG systems, and open-source tools validated against real-world data. I also have the founder empathy to support Camp companies through their hardest product decisions, because I've lived through them myself.

Your portfolio — Hugging Face, Stability AI, and 150+ companies across your history — signals you value product velocity and pragmatic execution over theory. That's exactly how I operate.

I'm currently in VC Lab (Decile Group) building an AI-focused fund and based in NYC. I'd love to explore how I can contribute to your investment team and support the next generation of agent systems companies.

Best regards,

Florian Ziesche
