# FutureSight Ventures — EIR Application

**Subject:** EIR Interest — Former B2B AI CEO, €5.5M raised, built for BMW/Siemens/Bosch

---

Hi FutureSight team,

After 5 years building and scaling enterprise AI products — shipping cloud CV systems to BMW, Siemens, and Bosch — I know exactly where vertical B2B AI breaks: not at the model layer, but at the last mile where workflows meet messy enterprise reality. That's why FutureSight's studio model resonates. You're not funding slide decks — you're co-building companies with operators who've done the hard part before.

**What I bring to an EIR seat:**

As CEO/Founder of 36ZERO Vision, I raised €5.5M+, signed 15+ enterprise clients, and managed P&L inside a 150-person organization. I built production AI systems — RAG pipelines with <0.2% hallucination rates, multi-agent architectures, and inference optimization — not demos, but software that BMW runs in production. I've sat across from procurement teams at Siemens and navigated 12-month enterprise sales cycles. That pattern recognition — what separates a real technical moat from an API wrapper — is hard to get from a spreadsheet.

**Why FutureSight specifically:**

Your thesis on vertical B2B AI automating professional services is exactly where I'm building right now. Through Ainary Ventures (https://ainaryventures.com), I'm developing AI-powered research pipelines and automated due diligence reports — the same document workflow automation FutureSight targets. Watching your Feb 13 fireside chat with Stephan and Justin confirmed what your "Co-Found" page makes clear: you want founders who've already failed and learned, not first-timers with ideas. I've done the failing. More importantly, I've done the building back.

I'm technical enough to evaluate architectures and commercial enough to close enterprise deals — the combination your EIRs need to take a venture from studio concept to first revenue. Based between NYC and Germany, I also bring a DACH enterprise network that surfaces B2B AI opportunities before they hit US radar.

Happy to discuss over a call or coffee in the city.

Best,
Florian Ziesche
