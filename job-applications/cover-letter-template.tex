% Paragraph 1: Hook + Why This Fund
%-------------------------
I'm applying for the Associate position at [FUND_NAME] because [SPECIFIC_REASON_WHY_THIS_FUND]. 

% Example variants:
% - "your thesis on AI-native B2B infrastructure aligns directly with my experience building..."
% - "your investment in [PORTFOLIO_COMPANY] demonstrates the kind of technical founder support I want to provide..."
% - "having raised from [SIMILAR_FUND], I understand the value of operators-turned-investors..."

[THESIS_ALIGNMENT_SENTENCE]

%-------------------------
% Paragraph 2: Operator Credibility
%-------------------------
As Founder \& CEO of 36ZERO Vision, I raised \texteuro5.5M+ across multiple rounds and built a cloud computer vision platform from zero to production deployment with enterprise customers. I learned firsthand what separates founders who execute from those who don't—and I developed a radar for the operational patterns that predict success.

%-------------------------
% Paragraph 3: Technical Differentiation (AI Expertise)
%-------------------------
What sets me apart is deep technical expertise in AI systems. I recently built a Legal AI platform with <0.2\% hallucination rates using multi-agent RAG architectures—the same techniques that will define the next wave of AI startups. I can evaluate technical founders, assess AI architectures, and identify where the real moats are being built.

%-------------------------
% Paragraph 4: Why VC Now
%-------------------------
[WHY_VC_PARAGRAPH]

% Example variants:
% - "After five years in the arena, I want to multiply my impact by backing 20+ founders instead of one company."
% - "The transition from operator to investor is rare—most VCs haven't felt the weight of making payroll or the pain of a failed pivot. I have."
% - "I've advised 10+ startups through fundraising and realized I'm most energized when helping founders solve their hardest problems."

%-------------------------
% Paragraph 5: Specific Value-Add
%-------------------------
At [FUND_NAME], I would bring:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sourcing:} Deep network in AI/ML communities and German startup ecosystem
    \item \textbf{Evaluation:} Technical due diligence on AI architectures and moat defensibility
    \item \textbf{Support:} Hands-on help with fundraising, GTM, and operational scaling
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------
% Closing
%-------------------------
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my operator experience and AI expertise can contribute to [FUND_NAME]'s mission. I'm currently based in [LOCATION] and available for a conversation at your convenience.

\closing{Best regards,}

\end{letter}
