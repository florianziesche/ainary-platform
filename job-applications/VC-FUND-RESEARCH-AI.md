## 📧 Outreach Templates

### Cold Email to AI Fund

```
Subject: AI Operator → VC Transition

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Fund]'s work in AI — [specific investment or content piece] particularly resonated.

Quick background: I spent 5 years as a startup CEO building AI systems. Most recently, I architected a legal AI with <0.2% hallucination rate using multi-agent verification. 

I'm now transitioning to VC because I want to support the next generation of AI founders — with actual technical depth, not just pattern matching.

Would love to learn more about [Fund]'s approach to evaluating AI companies. 

Open to a brief call?
