Rudina,

Your Five-Stage Agent Autonomy Framework nails the problem: 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail not because models are weak, but because agents lack the cognition to move beyond Stage 2. I built the open-source bridge from Stage 3 to Stage 4.

My AgentTrust framework (github.com/fziescheus-alt/agenttrust) operationalizes the trust dimension your framework describes — calibrating when agents should act autonomously vs. defer to humans, with real measurement instead of vibes. Three primitives: Budget-CoCoA calibration (3 independent samples → real confidence), Trust Scores (earned autonomy, not assumed), and mandatory Beipackzettel metadata on every output. It's the missing layer between "the model is smart" and "the agent is reliable."

This isn't academic. As CEO/COO at 36ZERO Vision, I built enterprise AI SaaS for BMW, Siemens, and Bosch. Raised €5.0M+. Shipped production RAG at <0.2% hallucination. I know which AI products survive procurement and which die in pilot — the exact filter your Stage 3/4 distinction captures.

What I'd bring to Glasswing:

- **Technical due diligence** — I evaluate agent architectures, inference costs, and data flywheels hands-on.
- **The Stage 2→3 filter** — 5 years selling AI to German industrials taught me which products are demos and which are businesses.
- **European deal flow** — DACH network that surfaces AI-native enterprise startups before US radar.
- **Portfolio support** — I've been the founder on the other side. I know what operator help actually looks like.

I'm based between NYC and Germany, currently in VC Lab (Decile Group). Happy to walk through how AgentTrust maps to your framework — or do a technical deep-dive on a portfolio company's agent architecture.
