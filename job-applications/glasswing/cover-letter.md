**Subject:** Agent Trust Calibration — From Your Framework to Open Source

---

Rudina,

Your 5-Stage Agent Autonomy Framework defines autonomy as a spectrum based on context, capability, and trust. I built the open-source implementation of that idea. My AgentTrust framework (github.com/fziescheus-alt/agenttrust) operationalizes exactly what your framework describes theoretically — calibrating when AI agents should act autonomously vs. defer to humans, mapped across trust dimensions. My "State of AI Agent Trust 2026" research directly extends the evaluation lens Glasswing applies to portfolio decisions.

This isn't academic for me. As CEO/COO at 36ZERO Vision, I built and scaled enterprise AI SaaS — cloud computer vision for BMW, Siemens, and Bosch. Raised €5.5M+. Managed P&L in a 150-person org. Shipped a RAG system with <0.2% hallucination rate to production. I know what separates real AI moats from demo-ware because I've built the infrastructure that enterprise buyers actually sign contracts for.

What I'd bring to Glasswing specifically:

- **Technical due diligence** — I evaluate agent architectures, inference economics, and data flywheels hands-on. Not from a spreadsheet.
- **Enterprise AI pattern recognition** — 5 years selling AI to German industrials taught me which products survive procurement and which die in pilot.
- **European deal flow** — My DACH network surfaces AI-native enterprise and cybersecurity startups before they hit US radar.
- **Portfolio support** — I've been the founder on the other side. I know what operator help actually looks like vs. "let me intro you to someone."

Glasswing's thesis — AI-native enterprise and cybersecurity at Seed/Series A — maps directly to the market I operated in. Your approach of investing where AI is the product, not a feature, is the filter I applied building my own investment thesis at Ainary Ventures (ainaryventures.com).

I'm based between NYC and Germany. Happy to walk through how AgentTrust maps to your framework or discuss a specific portfolio company's agent architecture.

## Self-Audit

- [x] Three WHYs structure: ✅ (Why Me → Why VC/what I bring → Why Glasswing)
- [x] Hook references Agent Autonomy Framework + AgentTrust: ✅ (first paragraph)
- [x] No "passionate about venture capital": ✅
- [x] No generic praise: ✅
- [x] Operator-to-VC framing: ✅ (founder side, not "failed founder")
- [x] Links: ainaryventures.com ✅, GitHub ✅
- [x] Specific portfolio/thesis knowledge: ✅ (framework details, thesis alignment)
- [x] Word count: ~320 words ✅ (under 400)
- [x] CTA: ✅ (specific — walk through AgentTrust mapping)
- [x] Rudina's name spelled correctly: ✅

**Confidence: 88%** — Strong thesis overlap hook. Uncertainty: couldn't verify current open roles, so framed as general operating/platform outreach rather than specific position.
