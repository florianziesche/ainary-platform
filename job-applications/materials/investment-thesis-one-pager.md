## The Opportunity

The next wave of enterprise value creation will come from **AI-native vertical software** — purpose-built solutions that embed AI at the core for specific industries.

**Why now:**
- Foundation models have reached production quality
- Vertical expertise creates defensible moats
- Incumbents are too slow to rebuild from scratch
- SMB/mid-market is underserved and ready

## Thesis

### 1. AI-Native > AI-Enhanced

The winners won't be incumbents adding AI features. They'll be startups building **AI-first architectures** for specific workflows.

| AI-Enhanced (Weak) | AI-Native (Strong) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Chatbot on existing software | Workflow rebuilt around AI |
| Feature checkbox | Core value proposition |
| Incremental improvement | 10x improvement |

**Example:** GitHub Copilot vs. Cursor. Copilot is AI-enhanced. Cursor rebuilt the IDE around AI. Cursor wins.

### 2. Verticals Beat Horizontals

Horizontal AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) are commoditizing. Vertical AI captures value by:
- Deep domain expertise embedded in prompts/training
- Workflow-specific integrations
- Industry-specific compliance (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)
- Higher willingness-to-pay from specialized buyers

**Target verticals:** Legal, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Construction, Logistics

### 3. SMB/Mid-Market is the Sweet Spot

Enterprise is crowded (Microsoft, Salesforce). SMB is underserved:
- No internal AI teams
- Can't afford custom development
- Ready for packaged solutions
- Faster sales cycles

## Example Opportunity: Manufacturing Software

**Problem:** CNC manufacturing shops waste 10+ hours/week on manual calculations.

**Solution:** AI-native planning software that reduces calculation time by 93%.

**Why AI-Native:** 
- Automatic time estimation from part geometry
- NC code generation from natural language
- Learning from historical production data

**Market:** 50,000+ CNC shops in DACH alone, avg. 20 employees.

**Defensibility:** Domain expertise + customer data flywheel.
