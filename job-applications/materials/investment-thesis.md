# Investment Thesis: AI-Native Enterprise Software

## The Core Thesis

**AI will restructure every enterprise software category within 5 years. The winners won't be AI features bolted onto existing products — they'll be AI-native companies that reimagine workflows from first principles.**

---

## Why Now

### 1. The Capability Unlock (2024-2026)
- LLMs crossed the reliability threshold for enterprise use
- Tool-calling accuracy exceeded 90% in late 2024
- Multi-agent systems are production-ready
- Cost per token dropped 10x in 18 months

### 2. The Adoption Wave (2025-2027)
- Enterprises moved from "AI pilot" to "AI-first" mandates
- Gartner: 50% of enterprises will use specialized AI models by 2028
- The "AI-native generation" is entering the workforce

### 3. The Displacement Opportunity
- Incumbent software was designed for human operators
- AI-native software is designed for AI operators + human governors
- This is not incremental improvement — it's architectural change

---

## Where I Focus

### Vertical AI for Knowledge Work
Industries where expertise compounds and accuracy matters:

| Vertical | Opportunity | Example Thesis |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Legal** | Contract analysis, due diligence, compliance | Sub-1% hallucination RAG systems |
| **Finance** | Research, analysis, reporting | Verified-source AI analysts |
| **Healthcare** | Clinical decision support, admin | HIPAA-compliant AI workflows |
| **Manufacturing** | Process optimization, quality | Real-time anomaly detection |

### AI Infrastructure for Enterprises
The picks and shovels:

- **Observability:** Monitoring AI agents at scale
- **Governance:** Audit trails, compliance, control
- **Memory:** Persistent context across sessions
- **Orchestration:** Multi-agent coordination

### AI-Native Workflow Tools
Horizontal tools reimagined:

- Project management where AI does 80% of updates
- CRM where AI handles follow-ups autonomously
- Documentation that writes itself

## What I Look For

### In Founders
1. **Domain expertise** — Deep understanding of the workflow they're automating
2. **Technical chops** — Can build the hard AI parts, not just wrapper apps
3. **Contrarian insight** — Sees something the market doesn't (yet)
4. **Operator DNA** — Has felt the pain firsthand

### In Products
1. **10x better, not 10% better** — Workflow transformation, not feature addition
2. **AI-native architecture** — Built for agents, not retrofitted
3. **Defensible data loops** — Gets better with usage
4. **Enterprise-ready** — Security, compliance, integration from day 1

### In Markets
1. **Large TAM** — $1B+ addressable market
2. **Urgent pain** — Customers actively seeking solutions
3. **Willingness to pay** — Not nice-to-have, must-have
4. **Distribution clarity** — Clear path to first 10 customers

---

## What I Avoid

- **AI wrappers** — Thin layer on top of GPT-4
- **Demo-ware** — Impressive demos, fragile in production
- **Solution in search of problem** — Technology-first, not pain-first
- **Commodity plays** — No differentiation beyond first-mover

---

## Why Me

### Operator Background
- **5 years** as startup CEO in computer vision / AI
- **€5.0M raised** across VC rounds and grants
- **Built and shipped** enterprise AI products
- **Sold to enterprises** — understand procurement cycles

### Technical Depth
- Hands-on with LLMs, RAG systems, multi-agent architectures
- Built a legal AI platform with <0.2% hallucination rate
- Use AI tools daily for 10x productivity

### Network Access
- **VC Lab Cohort 10** — Building fund relationships
- **Munich AI ecosystem** — Deep connections in German tech
- **NYC presence** — Based between NYC and Germany

---

## Sample Investment Criteria

### Stage: Pre-Seed to Seed
- Pre-product or early product
- Team of 2-4 with technical co-founder
- Some early signal (LOIs, pilots, design partners)

### Check Size (Future Fund): $250K-$500K
- Target 10-15% ownership at entry
- Reserve for follow-on

### Geography: US + Europe
- Strong preference for NYC, SF, Berlin, Munich
- Open to remote-first with strong team

---

## Conclusion

The enterprise software stack is being rebuilt. The companies that win will be AI-native from day one — built for a world where AI does the work and humans provide judgment.

I'm looking for founders who see this shift and are building the future of work.
