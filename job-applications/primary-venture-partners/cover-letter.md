**Role:** Associate (speculative)
**Status:** DRAFT — needs research on current openings

Dear Primary Venture Partners Team,

I'm a former startup CEO transitioning to venture capital, and Primary's seed-stage focus and operator-friendly reputation caught my attention.

## Why Primary

Primary's approach to working closely with founders at the earliest stages aligns with where I believe I can add the most value. Having raised €5.5M for my own startup and advised numerous founders on fundraising, I understand the seed-stage journey intimately.

## My Background

**36ZERO Vision (Founder/CEO, 2019-2024):**
- Cloud-based computer vision SaaS for industrial quality inspection
- Raised €4M equity + €1.5M in grants
- Built and led team of 12 engineers
- Sold to enterprise customers including automotive suppliers

**Current Focus:**
- VC Lab Fellow (Cohort 10) — building fund management skills
- Building AI-native software products
- Advising early-stage founders on fundraising and go-to-market

## What I'd Contribute

1. **Founder Empathy:** I've lived the early-stage journey — the fundraising, the pivots, the hard conversations
2. **Technical Evaluation:** Deep AI/ML expertise for evaluating technical founders and products
3. **NYC Presence:** Based in NYC, can support portfolio companies locally
4. **B2B Experience:** Enterprise sales background relevant to Primary's B2B focus

## My Thesis

I'm most excited about AI-native vertical software — purpose-built solutions that embed AI at the core for specific industries. I see particular opportunity in:
- Manufacturing and industrial software
- Legal and compliance tech
- Healthcare administration

I'd love to learn more about Primary's current areas of focus and explore whether there's a fit.

Best regards,
Florian Ziesche
