# LinkedIn Post — "What breaks when you run an agent 12h/day"

I run an AI agent 12 hours a day. Here's what breaks.

Not the API. Not the model. Trust.

After 3 months of daily agent usage — real work, not demos — I've learned:

𝟏. 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲.
The agent earns trust through correct outputs, loses it through errors. High trust → it acts autonomously. Low trust → I decide. This isn't theoretical. It runs every day in my workflow. Confidence-scored outputs, threshold-based autonomy.

𝟐. 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐲 𝐢𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐢𝐬𝐞.
I built a layered memory architecture: daily logs → weekly distillation → monthly core updates. Anti-entropy rules filter what persists. The question isn't "can it remember?" — it's "can it forget the right things?"

𝟑. 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 > 𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐭.
A system that gets 1% better daily beats a brilliant one-shot. Every output feeds the next input. Research feeds content. Content feeds leads. Leads feed revenue. Revenue funds more research. The flywheel is the product.

I'm not building another AI tool. I'm building a system that builds itself.

If you're running agents in production (not demos), I'd love to compare notes.
