# Cover Letter — Primary OIR: Agents

Brian,

I run an AI agent as my operating system. Not a demo. Production.

I built OpenClaw into a compound execution layer. 30+ tool integrations, layered memory that persists and distills, trust scoring that determines when the agent acts vs. asks me. Every day it gets smarter.

Before this, five years as CEO of an AI company in Munich. Raised €5M. Shipped computer vision to BMW, Siemens, Bosch. Built a team from 0 to 15. Learned what breaks when you go from prototype to production, and that lesson shapes everything I build now.

What I've discovered building agent systems daily:

- Trust is the bottleneck, not capability. Only 6% of companies fully trust AI agents (HBR, Dec 2025). I built a trust-as-a-currency framework: confidence-scored outputs, threshold-based autonomy, calibrated through real outcomes.
- Memory without decay is noise. Layered architecture with anti-entropy rules. The system forgets what doesn't matter.
- Compound beats smart. A system that gets 1% better daily outperforms a brilliant one-shot.

I also consult for German/US startups on AI systems. Helped raise $700K, supported a YC admission. Built automated workflows and MVPs.

I saw your TBC investment. Biological computing at 20 watts unlocks local agent deployment patterns that cloud can't touch. Privacy, latency, energy economics. That's the intersection I want to build at.

I'm based in New York. This role is what I want to do next: build agent systems that become companies, with a team that thinks in frameworks, not features. I want to build 5 companies in 5 years with Primary's machine, not 1 alone.

Would love to show you what I've built.
