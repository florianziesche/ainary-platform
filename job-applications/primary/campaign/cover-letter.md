# Cover Letter — Primary OIR: Agents

Brian —

I run an AI agent 12 hours a day. Not as a demo. As my operating system.

I built OpenClaw into a compound execution layer — 30+ tool integrations, layered memory that persists and distills, trust scoring that determines when the agent acts vs. asks me. Every day it gets smarter. Every output feeds the next input.

Before this, I spent five years as CEO of an AI startup in Munich. Raised €5M. Shipped to BMW, Siemens, Bosch. Built a team of 15. Learned what breaks when you go from prototype to production — and that lesson shapes everything I build now.

What I've discovered building agent systems daily:
- Trust is the bottleneck, not capability. I built a trust-as-a-currency framework — confidence-scored outputs, threshold-based autonomy, calibrated through real outcomes.
- Memory without decay is noise. I designed a layered architecture with anti-entropy rules — the system forgets what doesn't matter.
- Compound beats smart. A system that gets 1% better daily outperforms a brilliant one-shot.

I'm building an outcome-based execution UI that combines all three — agent OS + trust scoring + flywheel pipeline. Running daily experiments on what compounds.

I'm based in New York. This role is exactly what I want to do next — build agent systems that become companies, with a team that thinks in frameworks, not features.

Would love to show you what I've built.
