# Twitter Strategy — @BSchech

## Approach
Find a recent tweet about AI/agents/Etched. Reply with substance.

## Draft Replies (pick based on his recent tweet topic):

### If he posts about agents/AI:
"Been running an agent OS 12h/day for 3 months. Biggest surprise: the bottleneck isn't capability, it's trust. Built a confidence-scoring system — the agent earns autonomy through correct outputs. Trust-as-a-currency changes how you think about agent architecture."

### If he posts about Etched/hardware:
"This is why I've been benchmarking agent task completion on Apple Silicon vs. cloud APIs. For 80% of agent workflows, local inference is fast enough — and the latency/privacy tradeoff changes everything for personalized agents."

### If he posts about startups/founders:
"This resonates. Built an AI company for 5 years (Munich → BMW/Siemens/Bosch). The hardest lesson: the system matters more than the sprint. Now applying that to agent systems — compound execution beats clever features every time."

## Rules:
- NO "I applied to your role"
- NO self-promotion links
- Show THINKING, not credentials
- If he replies → THEN engage deeper, share links
- Max 280 chars for initial reply if needed, thread for longer
