## Investment Patterns & Themes

### 🎯 **Core Thesis: Vertical AI Dominance**
Primary is betting heavily on **AI applied to specific workflows**, not horizontal infrastructure:
- **Healthcare AI:** Valerie Health, Inspiren, Dandelion Health, K Health (earlier)
- **Financial services AI:** Tabs, Maybern, Alloy
- **Sales/GTM AI:** 1mind (most aggressive agent play)
- **Construction AI:** Bobyard (computer vision for vertical)

### 💡 **Stage Preference: Seed → Series A**
- Consistently leads or co-leads seed rounds
- Often follows-on in Series A (Inspiren, Etched, Maybern, Tabs)
- Fund V ($625M) maintains seed focus despite size

### 🚀 **Frontier Technology Bets**
Primary takes contrarian positions on **compute infrastructure**:
- **Biological Computing Company** - living neurons (most radical)
- **Etched** - ASICs for transformers
- Both challenge assumptions about compute efficiency and future AI infrastructure

### 🤖 **Agent-First Thesis**
Clear pattern toward **AI agents that replace or augment workers**:
- **1mind** - explicitly replaces GTM employees
- **Tabs** - AI agents in finance operations
- **Bobyard** - replaces estimator hours
- **Valerie Health** - automates healthcare tasks
- **Inspiren** - AI monitoring/decision-making

### 🏗️ **B2B SaaS, Not Consumer**
Almost entirely focused on:
- Enterprise software
- Fintech/financial infrastructure  
- Healthcare technology
- Vertical SaaS with AI

**Exception:** Chief (women's executive network) - but even that serves business leaders

### 🌆 **NYC Connection Weakening**
Originally "NYC's leading early stage firm," but recent investments show:
- **San Francisco:** The Biological Computing Company
- **California:** Bobyard (Menlo Park), Valerie Health (Lafayette)
- Fund V explicitly "nationwide" focus

### 💰 **Portfolio Impact Model**
Distinctive approach:
- Portfolio Impact team **outnumbers investors**
- Spend millions annually on value-add services
- Focus on helping companies "from seed to Series A"
- Track record: 2x Series A success rate, 19x unicorn rate

---

## What Primary DOESN'T Bet On

- ❌ Consumer apps/marketplaces (moved away from this)
- ❌ Web3/crypto (no evidence)
- ❌ Deep hardware (except AI-specific: Etched, TBC)
- ❌ Life sciences/biotech proper (prefer health tech/AI)
- ❌ Climate (occasional like Dandelion Energy, but not core)

## Key Insights for Applications

### 1. **Contrarian Compute Thesis**
Primary wrote the thesis ["Our Compute Thesis: Etched and Beyond"](https://www.primary.vc/articles/our-compute-thesis-etched-and-beyond) - they believe:
- Radical breakthroughs in compute needed for AI efficiency
- Outlier founders with unique perspectives will build the future
- Willing to back "stuff of sci-fi but very real" (TBC quote)

### 2. **Founder Profile They Love**
From TBC investment thesis:
> "Brilliant, on a mission, and wildly different"
- Deep domain expertise (neurosurgeons, ex-operators)
- Non-obvious backgrounds solving hard problems
- Long-term partnerships (TBC founders: 20-year collaboration)

### 3. **Vertical AI > Horizontal AI**
They're not investing in:
- General-purpose LLM wrappers
- Horizontal AI tools
Instead: **AI that deeply understands a workflow** (construction estimating, fund accounting, senior care)

### 4. **Market Timing Philosophy**
> "We back founders building things the world hasn't seen yet, **at the moment before the world believes**"

This explains TBC (biological computing), Etched (ASIC gamble), 1mind (AI replacing employees)

### 5. **2026 Investment Thesis Areas** (from website)
- **GTM Tech** (Cassie Young leading - see 1mind investment)
- **AI infrastructure/compute** (Brad Svrluga - see Etched, TBC)
- **Healthcare** (Sam Toole - see Valerie, Inspiren)
