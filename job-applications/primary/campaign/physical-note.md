# Physical Mail — Brian Schechter, Primary VC

## Contents:
1. Printed CV (HOF Design, color, heavy paper if possible)
2. Handwritten note (below)
3. Envelope → Primary Venture Partners NYC office

## Handwritten Note:

Brian —

I run an agent OS 12 hours a day.
Here's what I've learned: trust is the bottleneck, not capability.

I built a framework for it. Would love 15 minutes to show you.

## Address:
Primary Venture Partners
Attn: Brian Schechter
156 5th Ave (or 386 Park Ave S, 14th Floor)
New York, NY 10010
USA

(Two addresses found — verify which is current. 156 5th Ave is newer source.)

## Logistics:
- Print at local copy shop (Farbe, 120g+ Papier)
- Handwrite on good card stock, not printer paper
- Einschreiben International → DHL or Deutsche Post Weltbrief
- Timeline: ~5-7 business days Germany → NYC
- OR: Ask someone in NYC to hand-deliver? (Nancy?)

## Why this works:
- Nobody sends physical mail anymore
- Brian was a founder — he appreciates hustle
- The CV in HOF Design looks premium printed
- Handwritten = personal, not mass-blast
- "12 hours a day" + "trust is the bottleneck" = hooks that match his JD
