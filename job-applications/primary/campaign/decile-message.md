# VC Lab / Decile Network Ask

## Message (Slack/WhatsApp/Email to cohort):

Hey team — quick ask. Does anyone have a connection to Brian Schechter at Primary Venture Partners? They're hiring an Operator-In-Residence for their AI Agents incubation (Primary Labs) and it's a strong fit for my background. Would appreciate a warm intro if anyone knows him or the team there. Happy to share more context. 🙏

## Alternative (to Decile program lead directly):

Hi [Name] — I'm applying for the OIR: Agents role at Primary Venture Partners (Brian Schechter's team). Primary is NYC seed-stage, seems like there could be overlap with the Decile network. Any connections there I could leverage? Thanks!
