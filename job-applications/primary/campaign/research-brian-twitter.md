## 3 Most Recent Substantive Tweets (Non-Retweets)

### 1. The Biological Computing Company Investment
**Date:** ~February 12-13, 2026  
**Full Text:** Based on Primary VC article (Feb 13, 2026), Brian led the announcement of TBC's $25M seed round. While the exact tweet wasn't captured, the announcement was about backing neurosurgeons Alex Ksendzovsky and Jon Pomeraniec who are building biological computing using living neurons.

**Key Content:**
- TBC is building an organic computing platform connecting real living neurons with modern AI
- Shows 23x efficiency improvement in video model performance
- Brain operates at 20 watts vs. 120K watts for NVIDIA Blackwell to deliver same computational power
- First true commercialization of biological computing
- Primary led the $25M seed round (joined by Builders VC, Refactor Capital, Wonder Ventures, E1 Ventures, Proximity, Tusk Ventures)

**Engagement:** Not available (announcement primarily through Primary's blog)

## Best Tweet to Reply To: TBC/Biological Computing Announcement

### Recommendation: **The Biological Computing Company investment announcement**

### Why This Tweet:

**1. Perfect Timing & Relevance**
- Most recent (Feb 13, 2026 = 5 days ago)
- Active news cycle with significant tech media coverage
- Fresh conversation opportunity

**2. Strongest Agent-Systems Angle**
Multiple connection points:
- **Compute Efficiency for Agents:** Biological computing's 23x efficiency gain directly addresses one of agent systems' biggest bottlenecks—energy and compute costs at scale
- **Novel Architecture:** TBC isn't "brain-inspired" chips (neuromorphic)—it's actual living neurons as compute substrate. This represents a fundamental architectural shift similar to the jump needed for truly autonomous agent systems
- **Edge/Local Deployment:** 20 watts vs. 120K watts enables agent deployment scenarios impossible with current silicon (personal agents, edge devices, privacy-preserving local compute)
- **Multimodal Processing:** TBC's video model efficiency improvements are crucial for embodied agents and world models
- **Infrastructure Thesis Alignment:** Connects to his pinned tweet philosophy—building new infrastructure (biological compute) to harness the next wave of cleverness (agentic AI)

**3. Conversation Starter Value**
- Novel enough that most haven't connected biological computing ↔ agent systems
- Brian clearly believes in "radical breakthroughs in compute" (from TBC article)
- Primary Labs is actively incubating at "intersection of agents, edge, and AI" (from OIR job posting)
- Opens door to discuss:
  - Agent deployment architectures beyond cloud
  - Privacy/local-first agent systems
  - Energy economics of agent proliferation
  - Novel compute substrates for agentic workloads

**4. Demonstrates Domain Expertise**
A substantive reply about agent-systems implications shows:
- Deep understanding of compute/infrastructure
- Forward-thinking about agent deployment challenges
- Ability to connect seemingly disparate domains (bio-compute ↔ agents)
- Alignment with Primary's investment thesis

## Potential Reply Angles (Agent-Systems Focus)

**Option 1 - Efficiency Economics:**
"The 23x efficiency gain at TBC isn't just about cost—it unlocks entirely new agent deployment patterns. Current cloud-based agents hit compute walls at ~$X/query. Biological compute at 20W could enable personal agent fleets running locally, solving the privacy + latency problems blocking consumer adoption."

**Option 2 - Architecture Innovation:**
"TBC represents the first compute architecture genuinely *alien* to von Neumann—exactly what agent systems need. Current agents are brittle because they force sequential reasoning onto massively parallel problems. Living neural networks already solve this. The bridge between TBC's compute and agentic frameworks is the next frontier."

**Option 3 - Edge + Embodiment:**
"Biological computing at 20W enables what silicon can't: truly autonomous edge agents. For embodied AI/robotics, the power budget is existential. TBC's substrate could be the compute foundation for the 'agent on every device' future—phones, wearables, robots—all running personalized agents without cloud dependency."

## Research Confidence: 85%

**High Confidence:**
- TBC investment details (verified via Primary article + multiple news sources)
- Primary $625M fund announcement (verified via browser snapshot + TechCrunch)
- Pinned tweet content and engagement (verified via browser snapshot)
- Brian's investment thesis (verified via multiple sources)

**Lower Confidence:**
- Exact tweet text for TBC announcement (inferred from article; direct tweet not captured)
- Complete engagement metrics for TBC tweet (if it exists as standalone vs. embedded in article)
- Tweets between Feb 10-13, 2026 (browser had navigation issues; may have missed 1-2 tweets)

**Gaps:**
- Could not access full Twitter timeline beyond top 4-5 visible tweets due to browser redirects
- Direct verification of TBC tweet vs. article-only announcement unclear
- May be additional substantive tweets in Jan-Feb 2026 not captured

---

## Next Steps for Outreach

1. **Find the actual TBC tweet** (if exists) for direct reply
2. **Draft substantive agent-systems reply** incorporating one of the angles above
3. **Consider timing:** Reply within 7-10 days of announcement for relevance
4. **Alternative approach:** If no standalone TBC tweet exists, engage with fund announcement tweet but reference TBC in the context of compute for agents
