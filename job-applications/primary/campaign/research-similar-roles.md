## GAPS & UNCERTAINTIES

- **Compensation data:** Only 3 roles disclosed exact salary ranges. Rest are estimates based on industry benchmarks (Glassdoor, levels.fyi, Murray Resources 2026 AI salary report).
- **Remote flexibility:** Not all companies disclosed remote policies. Assumed mostly hybrid/in-office for VC-affiliated roles.
- **Hiring timelines:** No data on average time-to-offer. Anecdotal reports suggest 2-6 weeks for startups, 6-12 weeks for DeepMind-tier labs.
- **Agent-specific focus:** Some roles (Palantir, Glean) are broader "AI Engineering" but include agentic work. Confirmed via JD language ("agentic workflows," "tool-calling," "multi-agent").

## METHODOLOGY

**Research Protocol:**
1. **Hypothesis:** Agent-focused roles are concentrated at (a) VC incubation programs, (b) AI research labs, (c) well-funded vertical AI startups.
2. **Search strategy:** 
   - VC portfolio companies (Sequoia, Greylock, Lightspeed, Benchmark)
   - AI labs (DeepMind, Anthropic, Mistral)
   - Job board scraping (Lever, Greenhouse) + keyword filtering ("agent," "agentic," "OIR," "EIR")
3. **Saturation:** Stopped after 10 consecutive sources with no new high-quality roles (hit saturation at ~25 sources total).
4. **Validation:** Cross-checked all roles against press coverage, company funding announcements, and LinkedIn activity.

**Limitations:**
- Did not include startups <$20M funding (too early-stage, uncertain comp/runway)
- Excluded pure "Research Scientist" roles at academia (NYU, Stanford) — assumed preference for industry
- Did not include consulting firms (Deloitte, EY) despite their agent hiring — assumed preference for product/VC side

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Tailor CV/cover letter for Tier 1 roles (Primary OIR, AI Fund, Radical AI)
2. Reach out to 2-3 contacts at each company (via LinkedIn/warm intro)
3. Monitor job boards weekly for new postings (Lever, Greenhouse, company sites)
4. Prepare case studies demonstrating agent architecture knowledge (multi-agent systems, RAG, tool-calling)
