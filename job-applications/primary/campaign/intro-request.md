# Intro Request — Via Christian Busch's Partner

## Context:
- Florian knows Christian Busch's partner (COO, NYC)
- Christian Busch (Glass Cube Investments, Miami) has Jason Shuman (Primary) as LinkedIn connection
- Chain: Florian → COO → Christian → Jason Shuman → Brian Schechter

## Message to COO:

Hey [Name] — hope you're well. Quick favor: I'm applying for an Operator-In-Residence role at Primary Venture Partners (NYC seed fund, ~$1B AUM). The hiring partner is Brian Schechter. I noticed Christian has a connection to Jason Shuman at Primary — would you be open to introducing me to Christian so I could ask about a warm intro to the Primary team? Happy to send my background/CV in advance. Really appreciate it. 🙏

## Forwardable blurb (for Christian to send to Jason):

"Hey Jason — my friend Florian Ziesche is applying for the OIR: Agents role. He's an ex-CEO who built an AI company (€5M raised, BMW/Siemens/Bosch) and now builds agent systems full-time on OpenClaw. Thought you'd want to see his application — strong builder profile."
