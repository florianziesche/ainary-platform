## STEP 1: VC FUND STRUCTURES

### Traditional Funds

#### 1. AI Seed (London, UK)
**Website:** https://aiseedfund.com/  
**Founded:** 2017  
**Location:** London, UK  
**Focus:** Pure-play AI companies at pre-seed and seed stage across Europe. Europe's largest AI-focused early-stage portfolio with multiple exits (Odin Vision, Rahko, Observe, Facesoft, EYN).

**Managing Partner:** Michael Axelgaard (Founder & Managing Partner)

**Career Before VC:**
- Built and sold Inmedico, a medical software startup, to Natus Medical
- BSc in Engineering from UC Berkeley
- MPhil in Scientific Computing and Chemical Engineering from Cambridge
- Active in both European and Silicon Valley AI ecosystems

**What This Shows:** Axelgaard is a classic operator-turned-investor. He didn't come from consulting or banking—he built, shipped, and exited a healthcare software company before launching AI Seed. His technical background (Berkeley + Cambridge engineering) gave him the credibility to evaluate deep tech, but more importantly, he knows what it takes to sell to enterprises (Natus Medical acquisition) and navigate the valley of death. The thesis emerged from his operator experience, not from trend-spotting.

#### 2. Lux Capital (New York, USA)
**Website:** https://www.luxcapital.com/  
**Founded:** 2000  
**Location:** New York City (with presence in Menlo Park)  
**Focus:** Deep tech, AI, frontier sciences—seed through growth stage. Portfolio includes EvolutionaryScale, Runway, Hugging Face, Modal, Osmo. Strong NYC AI ecosystem presence with EU-US bridge (Hugging Face, Together AI, LangChain have NYC offices).

**Managing Partner:** Josh Wolfe (Co-Founder & Managing Partner)

**Career Before VC:**
- No traditional operator background—Wolfe co-founded Lux straight out of Cornell
- However, deeply technical: studied finance and political science, but early fascination with frontier technology and "contrarian bets on the edges of what's possible"
- Built thesis around "scientific contrarianism"—backing applied physics, deep tech, and hard science before it was mainstream

**What This Shows:** Wolfe represents the *thesis-first* VC. He didn't come from startups, but he built conviction around deep tech when everyone else chased consumer internet. Lux's edge isn't operator experience—it's **intellectual courage and market timing**. They went all-in on physical AI, robotics, and life sciences *before* the AI boom. That conviction paid off when NYC became the #2 AI hub (20% of US AI VC). For someone like me, this is a reminder: **the thesis matters more than the pedigree**. You don't need a Stanford MBA if you've built real conviction through lived experience.

### Venture Builders

#### 1. Entrepreneurs First (London, UK)
**Website:** https://www.joinef.com/  
**Founded:** 2011  
**Location:** London (with global cohorts)  
**Focus:** Pre-idea talent investor. Matches technical co-founders *before* they have a startup idea, provides equity-free grants, up to $250K initial funding, and follow-on up to $5M. Portfolio backed by Sequoia, a16z, SoftBank, Khosla. Produced multiple unicorns from zero.

**Managing Partner:** Alice Bentinck (Co-Founder & CEO)

**Career Before Venture Builder:**
- McKinsey & Company (management consulting)
- Met co-founder Matt Clifford at McKinsey in 2009
- Noticed entrepreneurship wasn't seen as a viable career path for top talent in Europe vs. Silicon Valley—decided to change that
- Part of Imperial College Innovations Investment Committee, UK government's AI Council
- Won Veuve Clicquot New Generation award

**What This Shows:** Bentinck saw a *structural gap* in Europe—brilliant technical people couldn't find co-founders or didn't see entrepreneurship as a path. She didn't build a product company; she built infrastructure for talent formation. McKinsey gave her the frameworks and credibility, but she left to solve a market failure. EF is the ultimate bridge for European founders entering the US—they derisk team formation, validate ideas, and provide capital. For my thesis (backing European founders building in the US), EF is the talent pipeline.

---

#### 2. The Flywheel (Athens, Greece)
**Website:** https://flywheel.vc/ (inferred from Tech.eu article)  
**Founded:** 2024 (launched December 2024)  
**Location:** Athens, Greece  
**Focus:** Industrial AI venture studio. Acts as co-founder, provides early risk capital and operational support through growth phases. Targets European industrial AI startups with US expansion potential.

**Managing Partner:** Kostas Fetfatsidis & Dimitrios Kourtesis (Co-Founders)

**Career Before Venture Builder:**
- Both have deep industrial and AI backgrounds (specific details not publicly available yet as it's newly launched)
- Identified the "valley of death" for European industrial AI—companies get stuck between research and commercialization
- Built The Flywheel to act as an on-ramp for Europe's next generation of industrial AI startups

**What This Shows:** The Flywheel is solving the same problem I've lived: European deep-tech founders struggle to scale in the US without operational support. Venture builders don't just write checks—they *de-risk execution* by embedding as operators. This model makes sense for capital-intensive, long sales-cycle businesses (industrial AI, manufacturing software). For my fund, I don't need to be a full venture builder, but I *should* act like one—roll up sleeves, help with US customer intros (I have BMW, Siemens, Bosch on my resume), and bridge the EU-US gap operationally, not just financially.

---

### Patterns & Lessons

1. **Operator Credibility > MBA Pedigree**  
   Axelgaard (Inmedico exit) and Bentinck (McKinsey but solving a lived problem) both leveraged *specific knowledge*—not generic prestige. I've got 5 years as AI startup CEO, 5 fundraising rounds, enterprise clients in 3 continents. That's operator credibility. Use it.

2. **Thesis Comes From Experience, Not Trend-Spotting**  
   - AI Seed: Axelgaard knew medical AI because he built in healthtech.
   - Lux: Wolfe bet on deep tech contrarianism early.
   - EF: Bentinck saw Europe's talent bottleneck firsthand.
   - The Flywheel: Industrial AI founders solving industrial AI's valley of death.
   
   **My thesis isn't theory—it's lived:** I'm a European founder who raised $5.5M, built AI-first products for German industrials, moved to NYC, and saw how broken the EU→US bridge is. That's not a pitch. That's a thesis.

3. **Geography = Edge (If You Own It)**  
   - AI Seed: London → Silicon Valley bridge for European AI founders.
   - Lux: NYC hub for AI talent (20% of US AI VC, #2 after SF).
   - EF: Global talent matching, but rooted in Europe.
   - The Flywheel: Athens → US industrial AI.
   
   **I'm in NYC temporarily based in Germany.** That's not a weakness—that's the bridge. Own it.

4. **Venture Builders Work When Capital Intensity + Execution Risk Are High**  
   Industrial AI, deep tech, hardware—these need more than money. They need operational support, customer intros, technical validation. If I'm backing European founders building AI-first in the US, I'm not just an allocator. I'm infrastructure.

5. **Small Funds ($5-15M) Can Win If Hyper-Specialized**  
   - AI Seed: $5-10M range (estimated), pure AI.
   - Baobab: $15M solo GP, AI/robotics/defense.
   - EF: Started small, compounded through specialization.
   
   **My $5M fund isn't small—it's focused.** Seed-stage, AI-first, European founders, US market. That's a wedge, not a weakness.

## STEP 2: VC ENTITIES

### Definitions (In My Own Words)

**Limited Partner (LP)**  
The people who give VCs money to invest. They're not running the fund—they're betting on the GP to find deals and generate returns. LPs include institutions (university endowments, pension funds), family offices, high-net-worth individuals, and corporate investors. They commit capital upfront, get called over time as deals close, and (hopefully) get distributions when portfolio companies exit. LPs care about three things: returns (IRR, TVPI), access (getting into funds they couldn't otherwise), and alignment (does the GP eat their own cooking?).

For me: LPs are partners, not just capital sources. They want consistent updates, transparency when shit goes sideways, and evidence I'm learning. The best LPs bring intros, advice, and follow-on capacity. The worst want control without context.

---

**General Partner (GP)**  
The people running the fund. GPs make investment decisions, sit on boards, negotiate terms, and are legally responsible for deploying the fund's capital. They earn two things: management fees (typically 2% annually of committed capital to cover operations) and carried interest (typically 20% of profits after returning LP capital). GPs are fiduciaries—they owe LPs loyalty and care. If the fund fails, GPs lose reputation and future fundraising ability, but LPs lose actual money. That asymmetry matters.

For me: I'm the GP. My job is to pick right, support hard, and communicate clearly. The management fee pays my rent; the carry is why I'm doing this. But reputation compounds faster than carry. One bad fund can kill Fund II before it starts.

---

**Management Company**  
The legal entity that operates the fund. This is the business that employs the GPs, collects management fees, pays salaries, covers legal/admin costs, and signs service contracts (law firms, auditors, fund admins). It's separate from the fund itself—it's the *operator* of the fund. Think of it as the fund's back office.

For me: Keep it lean. The management company should be efficient, not bloated. Management fees should cover essentials (salary, compliance, deal costs), not luxuries. Emerging managers who burn 2% on office space and assistants are idiots. Rent is paid by carry, not fees.

---

**Fund**  
The pool of capital committed by LPs to invest in startups. It's a limited partnership (legally), has a defined life (typically 10 years: 3-5 years to invest, 5-7 to exit), and operates under an LPA (Limited Partnership Agreement) that governs everything: how much the GP can invest per deal, recycling rules, fee structure, governance, conflict resolution. The fund doesn't "own" anything—it's just the vehicle. Portfolio companies are owned by the fund on behalf of LPs.

For me: The fund is a tool, not a trophy. $5M deployed well beats $50M deployed badly. The goal isn't AUM—it's returns. Fund I is about proving the thesis, building track record, and earning the right to raise Fund II.

---

**Portfolio Company**  
The startups the fund invests in. These are separate legal entities (usually Delaware C-Corps for US-focused companies). The fund owns equity (common or preferred shares) in exchange for capital. Portfolio companies have their own boards, cap tables, and destinies. The GP's job is to help them win—through intros, advice, follow-on capital, or just staying out of the way.

For me: Portfolio companies aren't line items. They're relationships. My job is to be helpful when needed, absent when not, and honest always. The best VCs are the ones founders call when shit hits the fan—not because they have to, but because they trust you.

### Diagram Descriptions

#### Diagram 1: Traditional VC Fund Structure

**Entities:**
1. **Limited Partners (LPs)** — Top of the diagram. Multiple boxes: "University Endowment," "Family Office," "HNW Individual," "Corporate LP."
2. **Fund (LP Entity)** — Center. Large box: "Fund I LP (10-year life)." This is the investment vehicle.
3. **Management Company (GP Entity)** — Adjacent to Fund. Box: "Management Company LLC." Employs GPs, collects fees.
4. **General Partners (GPs)** — Inside or connected to Management Company. "GP 1," "GP 2" (decision-makers).
5. **Portfolio Companies** — Bottom of diagram. Multiple boxes: "Startup A," "Startup B," "Startup C."

**Capital Flows:**
- **LPs → Fund (Capital Commitments):** LPs commit $5M total. Arrow labeled "Capital Calls" shows LPs funding the fund over time (not all at once).
- **Fund → Management Company (Management Fees):** Arrow labeled "2% annual management fee" flows from Fund to Management Company. This covers salaries, legal, operations.
- **Fund → Portfolio Companies (Investments):** Arrows from Fund to each startup. Labeled "$250K Seed Investment" (example). Fund owns equity in return.
- **Portfolio Companies → Fund (Returns):** When startups exit (acquisition, IPO), arrows flow back labeled "Exit Proceeds (Acquisition/IPO)."
- **Fund → LPs (Distributions):** After returning LP capital, arrow labeled "Capital Return + Profits" flows from Fund to LPs.
- **Fund → GPs (Carried Interest):** Arrow labeled "20% of profits" flows from Fund to GPs (only after LPs get their money back + preferred return, if any).

**Key Notes for Diagram:**
- **Waterfall:** LPs get their money back first, then 20% of profits go to GPs (carry).
- **Management Company = Separate:** It's not the fund. It's the business operating the fund.
- **10-Year Life:** Show timeline: Years 1-5 (deploy capital), Years 6-10 (harvest exits).

---

#### Diagram 2: Start Fund / Rolling Fund Structure

**Entities:**
1. **Limited Partners (LPs)** — Top. Same as above, but *more* LPs (smaller checks). Box labeled "100+ LPs ($10K-$50K each)."
2. **Series of Funds (Quarterly/Annual Closes)** — Center. Multiple boxes: "Q1 2025 Fund," "Q2 2025 Fund," "Q3 2025 Fund." Each is a separate legal fund but managed together.
3. **Management Company** — Same as Traditional Fund. Central operating entity.
4. **General Partners** — Connected to Management Company.
5. **Portfolio Companies** — Bottom. Same as Traditional Fund.

**Capital Flows:**
- **LPs → Quarterly Funds (Subscriptions):** LPs commit to ongoing subscriptions. Arrow labeled "Quarterly Capital Subscriptions" from LPs to each fund (Q1, Q2, Q3, etc.). LPs can join or leave each quarter.
- **Quarterly Funds → Management Company (Management Fees):** Same 2% fee structure, but calculated per fund vintage.
- **Quarterly Funds → Portfolio Companies (Investments):** Each quarterly fund invests into startups. Arrows from Q1 Fund → Startup A, Q2 Fund → Startup B, etc.
- **Portfolio Companies → Quarterly Funds (Returns):** Exit proceeds flow back to each vintage fund.
- **Quarterly Funds → LPs (Distributions):** Each quarterly fund distributes independently. Arrow labeled "Distributions (per vintage)." LPs in Q1 fund get Q1 returns; Q2 LPs get Q2 returns.
- **Quarterly Funds → GPs (Carried Interest):** Same 20% carry structure, but per vintage fund.

**Key Notes for Diagram:**
- **Flexibility:** LPs can subscribe or unsubscribe quarterly. Easier for smaller LPs.
- **Lower Barriers:** Traditional funds require $250K+ minimum. Rolling funds can go as low as $10K-$50K.
- **Complexity:** More legal entities (each quarter = new fund). More admin overhead.
- **Decile Hub / AngelList Infrastructure:** Note that platforms like Decile Hub or AngelList Rolling Funds handle the backend (legal, compliance, LP onboarding). This makes rolling funds viable for emerging managers.

**Differences from Traditional Fund:**
- **Traditional = One Big Close:** All LPs commit upfront, fund has fixed size.
- **Rolling = Continuous Closes:** New LPs join every quarter, fund grows over time.
- **Traditional = Longer Lock-Up:** LPs are in for 10 years.
- **Rolling = More Liquidity:** LPs can exit after lock-up period (typically 1-2 years per vintage).

## STEP 3: VC PROCESS — DEAL SOURCING (Detailed Outline)

**Why Deal Sourcing Matters:**  
The best deals don't come inbound. They come through relationships, reputation, and being in the right rooms before the round opens. For an emerging manager with a $5M fund, I can't outbid Sequoia. But I *can* out-hustle on sourcing. Founders choose investors based on speed, trust, and value-add—not just check size.

### Step-by-Step Deal Sourcing Process

#### 1. Define Your Thesis (The Filter)
**What:** Before sourcing, get crystal clear on what you're looking for. Thesis = competitive moat for sourcing. If your thesis is vague, you'll waste time on bad-fit deals.

**How:**
- Write down: stage (seed), sector (AI-first, deep tech), geography (European founders, US market), check size ($100K-$500K).
- Define anti-portfolio: what you *won't* invest in (consumer apps, crypto, services businesses, etc.).
- Share thesis publicly: blog posts, LinkedIn, Twitter. Make it easy for founders to self-select in or out.

**Example (My Thesis):**  
Seed-stage ($100K-$500K initial check), AI-first or deep-tech companies, European founders building for the US market, enterprise or industrial focus, technical founders who've shipped product. No consumer, no services, no marketplaces.

**Why This Matters:**  
Specificity attracts the right deals. If I say "we invest in AI," I'll get 1,000 pitches. If I say "we back European founders building AI-first industrial software for the US," I'll get 50—and 10 will be great.

---

#### 2. Build Sourcing Channels (The Inputs)
**What:** Identify where your best deals will come from. Track which sources historically deliver high-quality deal flow.

**Primary Channels:**
- **Co-Investor Referrals:** Other VCs, angels who've invested in your thesis area. Highest signal.
- **Accelerators:** Y Combinator, Techstars, Alchemist (deep tech), EF (European talent).
- **University Ecosystems:** MIT, Stanford, ETH Zurich, TU Munich (for deep tech).
- **Founder Networks:** Alumni of companies you've backed or worked at (BMW, Siemens, Bosch for me).
- **Angel Groups:** AI-focused angels, NYC angel networks.
- **Events & Conferences:** TechCrunch Disrupt, Slush (Helsinki), VivaTech (Paris), AI Summit NYC.
- **Online Communities:** VC Lab Slack, Decile Hub, AI founder Discords.

**How to Prioritize:**
- Track conversion: How many deals from each channel reached due diligence? How many closed?
- Double down on high-ROI channels. Cut low-signal sources.

**Example (VC Lab Article):**  
*"Track which sources consistently deliver strong deals—co-investor referrals, accelerators, universities, angel groups, or industry events—and concentrate effort where the ROI is highest."*

**My Channels:**
- **Alchemist Network:** I'm an alum—active access to deep-tech founders.
- **VC Lab Network:** 600+ emerging managers, many backing European founders.
- **NYC AI Ecosystem:** Lux, Work-Bench events, NYU/Columbia/Cornell AI labs.
- **LinkedIn:** 10K+ post reactions = warm intro pipeline.
- **European Founder Networks:** ETH Zurich, TU Munich, German startup scene.

---

#### 3. Build Visibility & Reputation (The Magnet)
**What:** The best deals come inbound *because* founders already know who you are and why you're valuable. Build a reputation as the go-to investor for your thesis.

**How:**
- **Content:** Write about your thesis. Share learnings from operating. Post on LinkedIn/Twitter weekly.
- **Founder Support:** Help founders even when you don't invest. Make intros, give feedback, open your network.
- **Events:** Host small founder dinners, office hours, workshops. Be *known* in your niche.
- **Referrals:** When you pass on a deal, refer to another investor. Founders remember.

**Why This Works:**  
Reputation compounds. The first fund is hard—no one knows you. But if you're helpful, transparent, and add value freely, founders talk. By Fund II, you'll have inbound flow.

**Example (My Playbook):**
- Post weekly on LinkedIn: "What I learned raising $5.5M across 5 rounds" or "How European founders can crack US enterprise sales."
- Host monthly "EU → US Founder Office Hours" in NYC.
- Use Alchemist + VC Lab networks to stay top-of-mind.
- Make 3 warm intros per week for founders I can't back.

---

#### 4. Use Tools to Scale Sourcing (The Leverage)
**What:** Manual sourcing doesn't scale. Use CRMs, AI tools, and automation to track more deals without burning out.

**Tools:**
- **Decile Hub:** AI-powered dealflow CRM. Tracks every intro, logs notes, flags follow-ups.
- **Harmonic / Affinity:** Relationship intelligence—who in my network can intro me to a founder?
- **Crunchbase / PitchBook:** Track funding rounds, new startups in my thesis.
- **AI Screening (VC Lab):** Use AI agents to scan pitch decks, flag thesis fit, summarize key points.

**Example (VC Lab Article on AI for VC):**  
*"Decile Hub's AI-powered deal tools are specifically designed to address these challenges, helping firms scale their deal analysis capabilities while maintaining high standards of due diligence."*

**My Stack:**
- Decile Hub: Log every pitch, track sourcing channels, measure conversion.
- Harmonic: Find warm intros to European founders in my network.
- Notion: Deal pipeline (Kanban: Sourced → First Call → Diligence → Pass/Invest).
- Loom: Record 5-min "why I passed" videos for founders (builds goodwill).

---

#### 5. Qualify Fast (The Filter, Part 2)
**What:** Most deals won't fit. Don't waste time. Get to "no" or "yes" in 1-2 calls.

**First Call (30 min):**
- Does it fit thesis? (Stage, sector, geography, team)
- Is the team technical? Have they shipped product?
- Is there early traction? (Revenue, LOIs, design partners)
- Is the problem real? (Talk to 2-3 potential customers)

**Decision After First Call:**
- **Pass (80% of deals):** Send thoughtful feedback. Offer to intro to better-fit investor.
- **Second Call (15% of deals):** Dive into product, market, competitive landscape.
- **Move to Diligence (5% of deals):** Deep dive on team, tech, customers.

**Why Speed Matters:**  
Founders raising seed rounds move fast. If I take 3 weeks to schedule a first call, they've already closed the round. Emerging managers win on speed, not brand.

**Example (My Process):**
- Inbound pitch → First call within 3 days.
- First call → Decision (pass / second call / diligence) within 24 hours.
- Diligence → Term sheet within 2 weeks.

---

#### 6. Nurture Long-Term Relationships (The Compound Effect)
**What:** Not every great founder is raising *right now*. Stay in touch. Some of the best deals take 6-12 months to mature.

**How:**
- Add to CRM: Tag as "Watch" or "Future Round."
- Send occasional value: Article, intro, product feedback.
- Check in quarterly: "How's it going? Can I help?"

**Why:**  
Founders remember who stayed engaged even when they weren't writing checks. When they *do* raise, you're top of mind.

**Example (My Approach):**
- Monthly newsletter to 100+ founders in my pipeline: "What I'm learning, who I'm backing, how I can help."
- Quarterly "founder dinners" in NYC + Berlin—invite pipeline companies.
- Use Decile Hub to automate "check-in" reminders every 90 days.

---

#### 7. Measure, Iterate, Improve (The Feedback Loop)
**What:** Sourcing is a process, not an event. Track what works, kill what doesn't.

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Volume:** How many deals sourced per month?
- **Conversion:** What % reach due diligence? What % close?
- **Source Quality:** Which channels deliver the best deals?
- **Speed:** Time from intro to first call? First call to decision?

**Iterate:**
- If accelerator deals convert poorly, deprioritize.
- If co-investor referrals convert at 20%, double down.
- If first-call-to-decision takes >1 week, streamline.

**Example (VC Lab Article):**  
*"One fund discovers 70% of quality deals come from referrals and 20% from conferences. They increase network outreach, pursue conferences only if there are speaking slots, and automate LinkedIn/e-mail filtering with AI tools."*

**My Approach:**
- Quarterly review: "Which 3 sources delivered the most diligence-worthy deals?"
- Monthly reflection: "Where did I waste time? Where did I add value?"
- Annual reset: "Is my thesis still right? Do I need to adjust sourcing strategy?"

---

### Summary: The Deal Sourcing Playbook (1-Pager for Me)

1. **Thesis:** European founders, AI-first/deep-tech, US market, seed stage.
2. **Channels:** Alchemist, VC Lab, NYC AI events, LinkedIn, European networks.
3. **Visibility:** Weekly LinkedIn posts, monthly founder dinners, 3 intros/week.
4. **Tools:** Decile Hub (CRM), Harmonic (warm intros), Notion (pipeline).
5. **Speed:** First call within 3 days, decision within 24 hours, diligence within 2 weeks.
6. **Nurture:** Quarterly check-ins, monthly newsletter, annual dinners.
7. **Measure:** Track volume, conversion, source quality, speed. Iterate.

**The Edge:** I'm not competing on brand or AUM. I'm competing on *speed, specificity, and sweat equity.* European founders building in the US need someone who's done it, gets it, and can move fast. That's me.

---

## STEP 4: DEAL SOURCING STRATEGY (Tailored for Florian)

### The Core Insight
I'm not building a generalist seed fund competing with a16z or First Round. I'm building a **bridge fund**—connecting European technical founders to the US market through *lived experience, enterprise credibility, and NYC ecosystem access*. My edge isn't capital—it's context.

---

### My Unfair Advantages

1. **Operator Credibility (5 Years as AI Startup CEO)**  
   - Raised $5.5M across 5 rounds (pre-seed through Series A).
   - Shipped AI products to BMW, Siemens, Bosch (enterprise sales cycles, procurement, compliance).
   - Survived the valley of death—know what kills startups and how to avoid it.
   
   **Why This Matters for Sourcing:**  
   Founders don't just want money—they want someone who's *been there*. When I tell a European founder, "I raised from German VCs, sold to German industrials, then moved to NYC," they listen. That's not a pitch—it's proof.

2. **EU-US Bridge (Lived Both Sides)**  
   - European roots (Germany): Network in German startup ecosystem, ETH Zurich, TU Munich.
   - US presence (NYC): Temporarily based, building relationships at Lux events, Work-Bench, Columbia AI labs.
   - Unique position: Can help European founders navigate US customer acquisition, fundraising, hiring.
   
   **Why This Matters for Sourcing:**  
   European founders building for the US face three problems: (1) no warm intros to US customers, (2) don't understand US fundraising norms, (3) struggle to hire US sales talent. I've solved all three. That makes me *useful*, not just another check.

3. **LinkedIn Reach (10K+ Reactions = Warm Intro Machine)**  
   - Proof of audience: My posts resonate with technical founders.
   - Inbound pipeline: People already know my story (AI CEO → VC path).
   - Network leverage: 10K engaged followers = warm intros to 100+ potential LPs, 500+ founders, 50+ co-investors.
   
   **Why This Matters for Sourcing:**  
   Warm intros convert 10x better than cold outreach. Every post is a sourcing channel. Every comment thread is a relationship. LinkedIn isn't social media—it's deal flow infrastructure.

4. **Alchemist Network (Deep-Tech Founder Alumni)**  
   - Alchemist Accelerator = top deep-tech, enterprise-focused program.
   - Alumni network = 300+ companies, mostly B2B/AI/hardware.
   - Active participation = access to batch after batch of thesis-fit founders.
   
   **Why This Matters for Sourcing:**  
   Alchemist founders are *exactly* my thesis: technical, B2B, solving hard problems. I'm not cold-emailing—I'm the alum who shows up, helps, and stays in touch. That's pre-built trust.

5. **VC Lab Network (600+ Emerging Managers)**  
   - VC Lab cohort = emerging fund managers globally.
   - Shared deal flow: Managers co-invest, refer, collaborate.
   - Shared learnings: What's working in deal sourcing, LP fundraising, portfolio support.
   
   **Why This Matters for Sourcing:**  
   I'm not building in isolation. If another VC Lab manager sees a European founder building AI for US industrials, they'll ping me. Reciprocal referrals = force multiplier.

---

### The Strategy (How I'll Actually Source Deals)

#### Phase 1: Build the Sourcing Engine (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Establish visible presence, activate networks, automate tracking.

**Tactics:**
1. **Content (Weekly LinkedIn + Monthly Blog):**
   - Write about EU → US founder journey: "5 Mistakes European Founders Make Selling to US Enterprise."
   - Share my fundraising story: "What I Learned Raising $5.5M Across 5 Rounds."
   - Post VC learnings: "Why Seed Stage Is About Team, Not Traction" (build credibility as investor, not just operator).
   
   **Output:** 1 LinkedIn post/week (aim for 500+ reactions/month), 1 long-form blog post/month.

2. **Events (Monthly Founder Dinners in NYC + Quarterly in Berlin):**
   - Host small (10-15 people) founder dinners in NYC: "European Founders Building in the US."
   - Partner with Lux, Work-Bench, or EF to co-host.
   - Quarterly trips to Berlin: Host similar dinners with ETH/TU Munich founders.
   
   **Output:** 1 dinner/month in NYC, 1 dinner/quarter in Europe. Track: How many attendees become pipeline companies?

3. **Activate Networks:**
   - **Alchemist:** Reach out to 20 recent portfolio companies. Offer office hours: "I've raised $5.5M and sold to enterprise—happy to help."
   - **VC Lab:** Join Slack, introduce myself, share thesis. Ask: "Who's seeing great European founders building AI for the US?"
   - **LinkedIn:** DM 50 founders in my target profile. Don't pitch—just offer value: "Loved your post on EU → US expansion. Happy to intro you to [X contact]."
   
   **Output:** 20 Alchemist intros, 10 VC Lab co-investor relationships, 50 LinkedIn DMs → 10 first calls.

4. **Set Up Tools (Decile Hub + Notion Pipeline):**
   - Decile Hub: Log every deal, track source, flag follow-ups.
   - Notion: Kanban pipeline (Sourced → First Call → Diligence → Passed / Invested).
   - Airtable: Founder CRM—track relationships even if not fundraising yet.
   
   **Output:** All deals tracked, no leads lost, clear view of pipeline health.

---

#### Phase 2: Test & Learn (Months 4-6)

**Goal:** Take 50+ first calls, move 5-10 to diligence, close 1-2 investments. Learn what works.

**Tactics:**
1. **Speed Wins (First Call Within 3 Days):**
   - Inbound pitch → Schedule within 48 hours.
   - First call → Decision (pass / second call / diligence) within 24 hours.
   - No "we'll get back to you in 2 weeks." Fast "no" > slow "maybe."

2. **Qualify Ruthlessly:**
   - First call questions:
     - "Why did you start this?" (Founder-market fit)
     - "Who's your first customer?" (Market validation)
     - "What's the hardest part of selling this?" (Go-to-market risk)
     - "Why raise now?" (Timing)
   - If 3 of 4 answers are weak → pass immediately.

3. **Add Value Even When Passing:**
   - "Not a fit for us because [specific reason], but you should talk to [X investor]."
   - Send Loom video: "Here's my feedback on your pitch deck."
   - Make intro to potential customer: "You should talk to [BMW contact]."
   
   **Why:** Founders remember. When they raise Series A, they'll remember I helped.

4. **Track Conversion:**
   - Metrics: 50 first calls → 10 second calls → 5 diligence → 2 investments.
   - If conversion is lower, diagnose: Is sourcing quality bad? Am I too slow? Is thesis too narrow?

---

#### Phase 3: Scale What Works (Months 7-12)

**Goal:** Double down on high-ROI sources, cut low-signal channels, build inbound flywheel.

**Tactics:**
1. **Measure Source Quality:**
   - Review: "Which 3 sources delivered the most diligence-worthy deals?"
   - Example findings:
     - Alchemist referrals → 30% conversion to diligence.
     - Cold LinkedIn DMs → 5% conversion.
     - VC Lab co-investor intros → 20% conversion.
   - **Action:** 2x time on Alchemist + VC Lab. Cut cold outreach.

2. **Build Inbound Machine:**
   - By now, 3-6 months of consistent content + events → people know my thesis.
   - Goal: 50% of deal flow is inbound (founders reaching out because they know I'm the "EU → US bridge" investor).
   - If inbound is <20%, double down on content + visibility.

3. **Nurture Pipeline:**
   - Use Decile Hub to automate: "Check in with [Founder] every 90 days."
   - Send quarterly email to 100+ pipeline founders: "Here's what I'm learning, here's how I can help."
   - Host annual "Portfolio + Pipeline Summit" in NYC—invite portfolio companies + top 20 pipeline companies.

4. **Recruit Co-Investors:**
   - By now, I've closed 2-4 deals. Identify co-investors who move fast and add value.
   - Build relationships: "We should co-invest more—here's my thesis, here's my pipeline."
   - Pre-negotiate: "If I bring you a deal in your sweet spot, can you move in 1 week?"

---

### How I'll Test & Improve

**Monthly Review:**
- Volume: How many deals sourced? Target: 20/month.
- Quality: How many reached first call? Target: 10/month.
- Conversion: How many moved to diligence? Target: 2-3/month.
- Speed: Time from intro to first call? Target: <3 days.

**Quarterly Deep Dive:**
- Source Quality: Which channels delivered? Which flopped?
- Founder Feedback: Ask founders (even those I passed on): "How was the process? What could I improve?"
- Portfolio Check-In: Are portfolio companies referring? If not, why?

**Annual Reset:**
- Thesis: Is it still right? Do I need to narrow or expand?
- Network: Are my sources refreshing, or am I relying on the same 10 people?
- Reputation: Am I known as the "EU → US bridge" investor? If not, what's missing?

### The Differentiation (Why Founders Will Choose Me)

**Speed:** First call in 3 days, decision in 24 hours, term sheet in 2 weeks.  
**Specificity:** I'm not generalist. I'm "EU → US, AI-first, enterprise" only.  
**Sweat Equity:** I'll intro to BMW, Siemens, Bosch. I'll help hire US sales reps. I'll debug go-to-market.  
**Credibility:** I've lived it—$5.5M raised, enterprise sold, valley of death survived.  
**Alignment:** Small fund ($5M) = concentrated bets. I *have* to make this work. I'm not diversifying across 50 companies.

**Bottom Line:** European founders building AI for the US don't need another check. They need someone who's done it, knows the pitfalls, and will open doors. That's me.

## STEP 7: LOCAL PRESENCE (NYC AI Ecosystem)

### Article Selected: "Transforming Venture Capital for 2025: Join the Change" (Decile Group)
**Source:** https://decilegroup.com/articles/venture-capital-insights-2025

**Key Themes:**
- Democratizing access to venture capital—lowering barriers for emerging managers
- AI-powered tools simplifying fund operations (Decile Hub)
- Building a global ecosystem connecting LPs with emerging GPs worldwide
- Making venture capital "fun again"—less paperwork, more supporting visionary founders
- Ethical investing through initiatives like the Mensarius Oath

---

### LinkedIn Post (Draft)

**Hook:**
The best time to break into venture capital was 10 years ago. The second-best time is now.

**Body:**
I just read Decile Group's vision for 2025, and it hit me: the gatekeeping era of VC is over.

For too long, launching a fund meant: 
- Knowing the right people at the right funds
- Raising $50M+ to be "taken seriously"
- Drowning in legal, admin, and LP reporting

That's changing. Fast.

Tools like Decile Hub, AngelList Rolling Funds, and VC Lab are making it possible to launch a fund in 6 months—not 6 years. AI is handling the grunt work (deal screening, LP updates, portfolio tracking). Emerging managers are proving you don't need a Stanford MBA and a Sequoia pedigree—you need a thesis, a network, and the guts to ship.

This matters to me because I'm building that fund—right here in NYC.

**My thesis:** Back European founders building AI-first and deep-tech companies for the US market.

**My edge:** I've lived it. 5 years as an AI startup CEO. $5.5M raised across 5 rounds. Enterprise clients like BMW, Siemens, Bosch. I know what it takes to cross the Atlantic and survive the valley of death.

NYC is the perfect base for this. It's the #2 AI hub in the US (20% of AI VC), the talent pipeline is surging (1 of every 7 tech workers moved here since 2019), and the ecosystem is founder-friendly. Lux, Union Square Ventures, Insight Partners—they're all doubling down. So am I.

The barriers are falling. The tools are here. The ecosystem is ready.

If you're an emerging manager, a European founder, or just someone who believes venture capital should be accessible—this is your moment.

Let's build.

### 5 Thoughtful Comments (Draft)

#### Comment 1: On Josh Wolfe's Post About NYC AI Ecosystem
**Context:** Josh posts about NYC becoming the #2 AI hub.

**Comment:**
"This is exactly why I'm building my fund here. NYC has something SF doesn't: sector diversity. AI isn't just consumer apps—it's healthcare, finance, industrials, logistics. That enterprise DNA + research talent (NYU, Columbia, Cornell) + capital (20% of US AI VC) = perfect launchpad for European founders entering the US.

The talent dividend is real. I've seen it: founders leaving Meta FAIR, Google DeepMind, Palantir to start companies here. They're choosing NYC not just for the lifestyle—but because customers are here. Fortune 500 HQs, financial services, media, pharma—all within 10 blocks.

For European deep-tech founders, NYC is the bridge. Thanks for mapping it, Josh."

---

#### Comment 2: On Grace Isford's Post About Lux Portfolio Companies Hiring
**Context:** Grace shares a list of NYC AI startups hiring.

**Comment:**
"This list is gold. Saving it.

One thing I've noticed: European founders building in the US struggle most with *hiring* US talent—not fundraising. They don't know how to sell the vision to someone who's never heard of their company.

The companies on this list (Runway, Modal, Hugging Face) have figured it out. They've built credibility fast by:
1. Shipping product people actually use
2. Being loud about their mission
3. Treating talent like customers (not resources)

For any European founder reading this: study how these companies hire. It's not just comp—it's storytelling."

---

#### Comment 3: On David Tisch's Post About Seed-Stage Market Dynamics
**Context:** David posts about seed valuations cooling down.

**Comment:**
"The seed market cooling is good news for *real* operators.

When valuations were insane (2021-2022), founders could raise on PowerPoint. Now? You need a product, customers, and proof you can execute.

That's exactly the environment where operator-turned-VCs win. I've raised $5.5M across 5 rounds, sold to BMW/Siemens/Bosch, and survived the valley of death. I know what *actually* matters at seed: team, product velocity, and go-to-market clarity.

Founders raising now need investors who've done it—not just written about it.

This is where European founders building in the US have an edge: they're lean, technical, and used to hard mode. They don't need hand-holding—they need someone who gets it."

---

#### Comment 4: On Cyan Bannister's Post About Deep-Tech Challenges
**Context:** Cyan posts about why deep-tech startups fail (even with great tech).

**Comment:**
"'Great tech, no customers' is the most common failure mode I've seen.

I built an AI startup for 5 years. We had cutting-edge ML, published papers, patents. But selling to BMW took 18 months. Siemens took 12 months. Bosch took 9 months (we got better).

What I learned:
- Enterprise customers don't buy tech. They buy risk mitigation.
- You need champions *inside* the company who'll fight for you.
- Pilots are free. POCs are free. The first paid contract is everything.

For European deep-tech founders entering the US, this is 10x harder. They don't have warm intros. They don't know procurement processes. They underestimate sales cycles.

That's where I can help. I've done it. I know the pain. And I have the BMW/Siemens/Bosch Rolodex to open doors."

#### Comment 5: On Eliot Durbin's Post About Emerging Manager Lessons
**Context:** Eliot shares what he's learned in Year 2 of running Bolden Ventures.

**Comment:**
"Eliot, this is incredibly helpful. Two things jumped out:

1. 'Your first LP is your hardest.' → 100%. I'm finding that the first 3-5 LPs set the tone. If they're high-quality (smart, patient, supportive), they attract more like them. If they're transactional, you're toast.

2. 'Under-promise, over-deliver on updates.' → This is where most emerging managers fail. LPs don't expect perfection—they expect honesty. If a portfolio company is struggling, tell them. If you made a mistake, own it. Transparency builds trust faster than fake wins.

Question for you: How did you balance *doing* (sourcing, diligence, portfolio support) vs. *communicating* (LP updates, content, visibility) in Year 1? I'm finding it's a 60/40 split, and I wonder if that's sustainable."
