## 1. Conviction (Sarah Guo)
**Stage:** Seed / Series A | **AUM:** ~$300M (est., intentionally small) | **Focus:** AI-Native "Software 3.0"
**Apply:** Email team@conviction.com or reach out via LinkedIn to Sarah Guo (@sarahxguo) or Pranav Reddy (@prnvrdy). No public careers page — small team of 8, hiring is opportunistic.
**Why fit:** Conviction backs AI-native startups transforming industries (Harvey, Mistral, Cognition, HeyGen) and values technical depth + operator judgment over financial modeling. Florian's hands-on experience building Legal AI and scaling a computer vision SaaS maps directly to how Conviction evaluates "Software 3.0" companies.

### Cover Letter

Dear Sarah and the Conviction team,

I'm reaching out because Conviction's thesis — that we are extremely early in translating powerful AI models into powerful products — mirrors exactly what I've spent the last several years doing as a founder and operator. I built and scaled 36ZERO Vision, a cloud computer vision SaaS company in Munich, from founding through €5.0M+ in capital raised, serving enterprise customers across manufacturing and retail. More recently, I architected a Legal AI platform using multi-agent RAG that achieved a <0.2% hallucination rate — the kind of technical precision that separates real AI products from demos.

What excites me about Conviction is your portfolio's focus on companies where AI isn't a feature but the product itself — Harvey in legal AI, Cognition in software engineering, Cartesia in inference. I've lived both sides of this equation: as a founder navigating the gap between model capability and production-grade product, and as a technical operator who understands why most AI products fail at the last mile of reliability.

I'm currently in the VC Lab program at Venture Institute, refining my investment lens, and I'm based between NYC and Germany — a useful vantage point for evaluating the European AI ecosystem where Conviction already invests (Mistral, Listen Labs). I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my operator perspective and technical depth could strengthen your deal evaluation and portfolio support.

Best regards,
Florian Ziesche

## 2. AIX Ventures
**Stage:** Pre-Seed / Seed | **AUM:** $202M (Fund II, 2024) | **Focus:** AI-native companies, future of work
**Apply:** https://careers.aixventures.com or email info@aixventures.com. Contact: Shaun Johnson (Co-Founder).
**Why fit:** AIX backs "AI unicorns" early (Hugging Face, Perplexity, Weights & Biases, Chroma) and employs AI practitioners as part of the investment process. Florian's deep technical background in LLMs, RAG, and agents — combined with operational founder experience — makes him the exact profile AIX hires: someone who can do technical deep dives alongside business evaluation.

### Cover Letter

Dear AIX Ventures team,

AIX's model of embedding AI practitioners into the investment process is why I'm writing. As a founder who raised €5.0M+ building 36ZERO Vision (cloud computer vision SaaS) and later engineered a Legal AI platform with <0.2% hallucination rate using multi-agent RAG, I bring exactly the blend of technical depth and company-building experience your approach demands.

Your portfolio reads like the infrastructure stack I used to build production AI: Hugging Face for model hosting, Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, Chroma for vector storage. I didn't just use these tools — I understand why they won their categories, what their architectural trade-offs are, and where the next generation of AI infrastructure gaps exist. This is the kind of practitioner lens I'd bring to evaluating your pipeline.

As MD/COO at 36ZERO Vision, I led product, engineering, and operations while managing a €1M+ fundraise. I understand the specific challenges AI-native startups face: from data pipeline reliability to inference cost optimization to the gap between a compelling demo and a production system enterprise customers will trust. I'm currently in VC Lab (Venture Institute) and based between NYC and Germany, giving me visibility into both US and European AI ecosystems.

I'd love to explore how I can contribute as an investor who speaks the same language as your founders.

## 3. Lux Capital
**Stage:** Seed to Growth | **AUM:** $5B+ (just closed $1.5B Fund, Jan 2026) | **Focus:** Deep tech, AI, science-driven ventures
**Apply:** https://www.luxcapital.com/careers or email careers@luxcapital.com. Key contacts: Josh Wolfe (Co-Founder), Brandon Reeves (Partner, AI focus).
**Why fit:** Lux was founded in NYC, made its first AI investment there, and backs companies like Runway, Hugging Face, Together AI, and Physical Intelligence. Their thesis spans AI + deep tech with a strong NYC ecosystem focus. Florian's computer vision background (36ZERO) plus Legal AI engineering aligns with Lux's appetite for technically ambitious founders-turned-investors.

### Cover Letter

Dear Lux Capital team,

Your recent piece on NYC's AI opportunity and the "Great Talent Dividend" resonated deeply — I'm one of those operators making the deliberate move from building AI companies to investing in them. I founded and led 36ZERO Vision, a cloud computer vision SaaS company where I raised €5.0M+ and navigated the full journey from technical prototype to enterprise customers. Most recently, I built a Legal AI platform achieving <0.2% hallucination rate through multi-agent RAG — the kind of reliability bar your portfolio companies like Runway and Hugging Face know is the difference between a research project and a business.

What draws me to Lux specifically is your conviction that the best AI investments require deep technical understanding, not just pattern matching on metrics. With over $5B AUM and a portfolio spanning from Hugging Face to Physical Intelligence, you're investing across the full AI stack — from foundational models to embodied intelligence. My experience bridges these layers: computer vision at the perception level, LLMs and agents at the reasoning level, and enterprise deployment at the product level.

I'm currently in the VC Lab program (Venture Institute), based between NYC and Germany, and bring a European network that complements Lux's growing transatlantic portfolio (Sakana AI, Mistral). I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical depth and operator experience can add value to your investment process.

## 4. FirstMark Capital
**Stage:** Seed / Series A | **AUM:** $2.5B+ (est.) | **Focus:** AI/ML, developer tools, infrastructure, enterprise
**Apply:** https://firstmark.com/careers/ or reach out via LinkedIn to Rick Heitzmann (Founder), Matt Turck (Partner), or David Waltcher (Partner, recently promoted — focuses on dev tools, AI, infrastructure, security).
**Why fit:** FirstMark is NYC's iconic early-stage firm (Pinterest, Shopify, Discord, DraftKings) with a strong AI thesis, community-driven deal flow, and deep enterprise networks. Florian's B2B SaaS founder experience plus AI technical chops match FirstMark's sweet spot of technical founders building category-defining enterprise products.

### Cover Letter

Dear FirstMark team,

FirstMark's community-driven approach to venture — from your Data Driven NYC events to the deep enterprise networks you've built over 15+ years — is exactly the kind of platform where my operator background can compound. I founded 36ZERO Vision, a B2B cloud computer vision SaaS company, raising €5.0M+ and building enterprise go-to-market from zero in Munich's tech ecosystem. More recently, I engineered a Legal AI platform with <0.2% hallucination rate using multi-agent RAG architecture.

David Waltcher's promotion to Partner and his focus on developer tools, AI, and infrastructure signals where FirstMark is doubling down — and it's precisely where I have the most technical conviction. Having built production AI systems that enterprises actually trusted, I know the difference between an impressive model and a deployable product. That evaluation lens is hard to develop without building it yourself.

I bring a European founder network that complements your portfolio's global ambitions, deep technical fluency across the AI stack (from model architecture to inference optimization to agentic systems), and the kind of GTM experience that comes from selling complex technical products to enterprise buyers. I'm in the VC Lab program at Venture Institute and based in NYC. I'd love to contribute to FirstMark's next chapter of AI investing.

## 5. Betaworks
**Stage:** Pre-Seed / Seed | **AUM:** ~$150M+ across funds | **Focus:** AI applications, interfaces, agent systems
**Apply:** https://www.betaworks.com/careers or email studio@betaworks.com. Contact: John Borthwick (CEO/Founder), Matthew Hartman (Partner), Peter Rojas (Partner).
**Why fit:** Betaworks runs thematic AI Camp cohorts (current: "Agent Systems" Spring 2026) and invests $500K per company in product-focused AI startups. They've backed Hugging Face, Stability AI, and are deeply NYC-rooted. Florian's hands-on agent/RAG experience and product-operator mindset align perfectly with their thesis on AI interfaces and agentic systems.

### Cover Letter

Dear Betaworks team,

Your Spring 2026 Camp theme — Agent Systems — is exactly the technical frontier I've been building on. I recently architected a Legal AI platform using multi-agent RAG that achieved <0.2% hallucination rate, which required solving precisely the challenges your Camp cohort companies will face: reliable agent orchestration, grounded retrieval, and production-grade agentic workflows that professionals actually trust.

Before that, I founded and scaled 36ZERO Vision (cloud computer vision SaaS, €5.0M+ raised), so I understand what Betaworks values most: product velocity and pragmatic technical execution. Your portfolio — Hugging Face, Stability AI, and the 150+ companies across your history — shows a consistent thesis that the best AI companies are built by people who obsess over the interface between powerful models and human workflows. That's my entire career in a sentence.

I'm in the VC Lab program at Venture Institute and based in NYC. What I'd bring to Betaworks is an operator who's built AI products in both vision and language, can do genuine technical diligence on agentic systems (not just ask about TAM), and has the founder empathy to support Camp companies through their hardest product decisions. I'd love to explore how I can contribute to your investment team.

## 6. Two Sigma Ventures
**Stage:** Seed / Series A | **AUM:** ~$500M+ (Fund III: $288M in 2020, Fund IV est. larger) | **Focus:** Data-driven companies, AI/ML, computing + information
**Apply:** https://twosigmaventures.com/careers/ or email info@twosigmaventures.com. Key contacts: Colin Beirne (Partner, AI/fintech), Matt Jacobus (Partner), Li Jiang (Partner).
**Why fit:** Two Sigma Ventures invests in "companies harnessing information growth and computing power," backed by the $60B+ quant hedge fund. Their thesis on data + computing + people maps directly to Florian's experience building computer vision and NLP systems where data quality and computational architecture determined product success.

### Cover Letter

Dear Two Sigma Ventures team,

Your thesis — that the most important companies sit at the intersection of exponentially increasing information, advancing computing, and visionary founders — describes the companies I've spent my career building. At 36ZERO Vision, I built a cloud computer vision SaaS platform that transformed raw visual data into actionable manufacturing and retail intelligence, raising €5.0M+ along the way. The hard part wasn't the models — it was building data pipelines reliable enough for enterprise trust and inference architecture efficient enough for production economics.

That experience directly informed my recent work on Legal AI, where I engineered a multi-agent RAG system achieving <0.2% hallucination rate. Legal is an industry where "good enough" AI fails completely — you need the quantitative rigor around data quality, retrieval precision, and output validation that I imagine resonates with Two Sigma's DNA.

What excites me about TSV specifically is how your parent company's data science resources create a differentiated support model for portfolio companies. As a technical founder, I know how valuable it is to have investors who can actually engage on ML architecture decisions, not just financial modeling. I bring deep technical fluency across the AI stack, operator experience scaling B2B SaaS, and a European network that opens deal flow in an AI ecosystem producing companies like Mistral and Stability AI. I'm currently in the VC Lab program and based in NYC.

## 7. Primary Venture Partners
**Stage:** Pre-Seed / Seed | **AUM:** ~$1B (including $425M recent fund) | **Focus:** NYC founders, B2B SaaS, infrastructure, fintech, healthcare, supply chain
**Apply:** https://www.primary.vc/careers/ or email hello@primary.vc. Key contacts: Brad Svrluga (Co-Founder), Ben Sun (Co-Founder), Cassie Young (GP).
**Why fit:** Primary is NYC's leading seed firm with the industry's largest Portfolio Impact team — they don't just write checks, they provide GTM support, talent, and finance resources. Florian's B2B SaaS founder experience (built GTM from zero at 36ZERO) and AI technical depth make him ideal for a firm that prides itself on hands-on company building at the earliest stages.

### Cover Letter

Dear Primary team,

Primary's stat — that a third of Fund I companies became unicorns — speaks to the power of your hands-on model. As someone who built 36ZERO Vision from founding to enterprise revenue, raising €5.0M+ while navigating every early-stage challenge from first hire to first enterprise close, I know exactly how much value a truly engaged seed investor creates. Your Portfolio Impact team's approach to GTM support, talent, and finance is the support model I wish I'd had as a first-time founder.

That operator perspective is what I'd bring to Primary's investment team. I've sat in the founder's chair for B2B SaaS — your core focus — and I've lived the specific challenges of selling AI-powered products to enterprises that are skeptical of the technology. My recent work building a Legal AI platform with <0.2% hallucination rate (multi-agent RAG) sharpened my ability to evaluate what separates AI products that achieve real enterprise adoption from those that stall after pilot.

I'm currently in the VC Lab program (Venture Institute) and based in NYC. I bring a technical lens that complements Primary's operational DNA — I can evaluate AI infrastructure decisions, assess technical moats, and support founders through the AI-specific challenges of building at the seed stage. I'd love to discuss how my founder experience and AI expertise can strengthen Primary's deal evaluation and portfolio support.

## 8. Bessemer Venture Partners
**Stage:** Seed to Growth | **AUM:** $9B+ | **Focus:** AI roadmap, enterprise SaaS, consumer, healthcare
**Apply:** https://www.bvp.com/careers or email careers@bvp.com. Key AI-focused partners: Talia Goldberg (GP), Mike Droesch (GP), Anna Khan (GP).
**Why fit:** Bessemer has deployed $1B+ into AI-native startups since 2023 (Anthropic, Render, Hyperscience) and publishes detailed AI investment roadmaps. Their "AI Systems of Action" thesis — that AI will transform enterprise operations, not just analytics — maps directly to Florian's experience building production AI that acts (legal document processing, manufacturing quality control), not just observes.

### Cover Letter

Dear Bessemer team,

Your "AI Systems of Action" roadmap articulates precisely what I've been building: AI systems that don't just analyze but operate within enterprise workflows. At 36ZERO Vision, I built computer vision systems for manufacturing quality control — real-time AI that made operational decisions, not dashboards. When I later built a Legal AI platform achieving <0.2% hallucination rate with multi-agent RAG, I focused on the same principle: AI that acts within the professional's workflow with enough reliability to earn trust.

Bessemer's $1B+ deployment into AI-native companies since 2023 — including Anthropic and Hyperscience — signals the scale of conviction needed at this moment. What I bring is the operator's perspective on which AI systems will actually achieve the "action" layer your roadmap describes. Having raised €5.0M+ and scaled a cloud SaaS company from zero, I understand the unit economics, deployment challenges, and enterprise adoption patterns that determine whether an AI company becomes a feature or a category.

I'm in the VC Lab program at Venture Institute and based between NYC and Germany. My cross-Atlantic perspective is relevant given Bessemer's global portfolio and the accelerating European AI ecosystem. I'm particularly drawn to Bessemer's apprenticeship model and would welcome the opportunity to contribute technical depth to your AI investment thesis.

## 9. SignalFire
**Stage:** Seed to Growth | **AUM:** ~$3B (raised $1B+ in 2025) | **Focus:** AI-native VC, applied AI, enterprise, consumer
**Apply:** https://www.signalfire.com/careers or email hello@signalfire.com. Key contacts: Chris Farmer (Founder/CEO), Ilya Kirnos (Co-Founder/CTO).
**Why fit:** SignalFire is literally built like a tech company — their proprietary AI engine "Beacon" drives deal sourcing and portfolio support, using data science the way quant funds use it for trading. Florian's technical ability to understand and contribute to AI-driven investment tools, combined with his founder operator experience, makes him uniquely suited for a firm that fuses VC with technology product development.

### Cover Letter

Dear SignalFire team,

SignalFire's founding premise — building a VC firm like a technology company — resonates because that's how I've approached everything I've built. From founding 36ZERO Vision (cloud computer vision SaaS, €5.0M+ raised) to engineering a Legal AI platform with <0.2% hallucination rate, I've always believed that technical rigor produces better outcomes. Your Beacon AI engine for investment decisions is proof this philosophy works in venture too.

What makes me a strong fit for SignalFire specifically is that I can operate on both sides of your value proposition: I understand the applied AI companies in your pipeline as a technical practitioner, and I can contribute to your internal AI tools and data-driven processes as someone who's built production ML systems. When I evaluate a startup's multi-agent architecture or RAG pipeline, I'm assessing from experience, not abstraction.

As a founder who scaled B2B SaaS across manufacturing and retail verticals, I bring the GTM pattern recognition your portfolio companies need from their investors. I'm currently in the VC Lab program (Venture Institute), based in NYC, and bring deep networks in both the US and European AI ecosystems. I'd love to discuss how my technical depth and operator experience can strengthen SignalFire's investment team and the next generation of applied AI companies you back.

## 10. HOF Capital
**Stage:** Multi-stage (Seed to Growth) | **AUM:** $1.5B+ | **Focus:** AI, enterprise software, frontier tech, fintech
**Apply:** https://hofcapital.com/careers/ or email careers@hofcapital.com. Currently hiring: "VC Investor" role (NYC-based). Key contacts: Michael Hoganson (Managing Partner), Samir Kaji (GP).
**Why fit:** HOF is a global NYC-based fund backed by 200+ influential families across 37 countries — they help portfolio companies access cross-border customers and markets. Florian's German/NYC dual base and experience building a European SaaS company with global ambitions makes him uniquely positioned for HOF's international thesis. Their Anthropic investment shows deep AI conviction.

### Cover Letter

Dear HOF Capital team,

HOF's global DNA — 200+ LP families across 37 countries providing portfolio companies with cross-border market access — is a differentiated model I'd be uniquely positioned to leverage. I founded and led 36ZERO Vision, a cloud computer vision SaaS company in Munich, navigating the specific challenges of building a European tech company with global enterprise customers. That experience taught me both the opportunity and the friction in cross-border AI company building — something most US-based investors understand theoretically but few have lived operationally.

Your portfolio's AI conviction (Anthropic, among others) aligns with my technical depth. I recently built a Legal AI platform achieving <0.2% hallucination rate using multi-agent RAG, and I've raised €5.0M+ across equity rounds and grants. I understand AI from model architecture to enterprise deployment to fundraising strategy — the full stack a multi-stage investor needs to evaluate.

Based between NYC and Germany, I bring real-time visibility into both ecosystems and a network spanning European tech, VC Lab (Venture Institute), and the German AI/enterprise community. For a fund that differentiates on global reach and cross-border value-add, I'd bring both the technical AI expertise to evaluate deals and the international operator experience to support portfolio companies expanding across markets.
