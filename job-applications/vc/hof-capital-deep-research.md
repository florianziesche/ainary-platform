## 💡 Talking Points for Cover Letter / Interview

### 1. Technical Depth Others Lack
"Most analysts evaluate AI demos. I build production AI systems. I can assess:
- Whether the architecture scales
- If the data moat is real
- Whether this team can actually ship"

### 2. Operator Lens on AI
"I've been on the founder side of AI fundraising. I know what technical founders need from their first check — and what they don't."

### 3. Conviction Through Building
"I don't pattern-match AI companies. I build alongside them — I run multi-agent systems daily, I know the difference between 'cool demo' and 'production-ready.'"

### 4. Global AI Network
"I bridge NYC and European AI ecosystems. Your portfolio is global — my network is too."

## 📝 Cover Letter Hooks (Refine from READY-TO-APPLY)

**Opening (grab attention):**
> "Your requirement for AI or SWE experience is exactly why I'm reaching out. I don't just evaluate AI companies — I build production AI systems."

**Body (credibility):**
> "I've built a legal AI platform achieving <0.2% hallucination rate using multi-agent verification. I can read code, assess architectures, and pressure-test technical claims — not just evaluate pitch decks."

**Why HOF specifically:**
> "Your conviction in generational companies resonates. OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI — you identify paradigm-shifting AI companies early. My daily practice building AI systems gives me the technical intuition to help you continue doing so."

**Close (action):**
