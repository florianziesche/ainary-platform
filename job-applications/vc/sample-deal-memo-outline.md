# Sample Deal Memo — Template & Example
## For VC Job Applications (Writing Sample)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate investment analysis skills  
**Format:** 2 pages max, clear structure  
**Tone:** Analytical but decisive

---

## Standard Deal Memo Structure

### 1. Executive Summary (3-4 sentences)
- Company name, sector, round
- Core thesis in one sentence
- Recommendation (Invest / Pass / More DD)
- Key risk

**Example:**
> "Acme AI is raising a $5M seed to build AI agents for enterprise sales teams. We see this as a category-defining play in the $50B sales automation market. **Recommend: Invest $2M at $20M post.** Key risk: Horizontal product may lack wedge."

---

### 2. Company Overview (1 paragraph)
- What they do (product)
- Stage (pre-revenue, early traction, scaling)
- Team size
- Location

**Example:**
> "Acme AI provides autonomous SDR agents that handle outbound prospecting, qualification, and meeting booking. Founded in NYC in 2024 by [founders], the 8-person team has built a working product deployed with 5 design partners. Pre-revenue, targeting $500K ARR by EOY 2026."

---

### 3. Market Opportunity (1 paragraph)
- TAM (Total Addressable Market)
- Wedge / ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
- Why now? (timing, catalyst)

**Example:**
> "Sales Development is a $15B market, but AI agents can compress 5 SDRs into 1 subscription. Wedge: Series A SaaS companies (5-20 AEs) who can't afford a full SDR team yet. Catalyst: GPT-4 level models crossed the 'good enough' threshold for outbound in 2025."

---

### 4. Product & Differentiation (2 paragraphs)

**What it is:**
> "Acme's agent handles LinkedIn prospecting, email sequencing, and objection handling via voice. Integrates with HubSpot, Salesforce, Outreach."

**Why it wins:**
> "Differentiation: Multi-channel (email + voice), not just text. Proprietary voice dataset (10K hours of real SDR calls). Team has sold $50M+ themselves — deep domain expertise."

---

### 5. Team (1 paragraph)
- Founders (background, why them?)
- Key hires
- Gaps (what do they need to hire?)

**Example:**
> "Co-founders: Jane (ex-Gong VP Sales, built $100M pipeline), John (ML engineer, ex-OpenAI). Strong product + GTM combo. Hired first AE (ex-Outreach). Need: Head of Eng (currently outsourced)."

---

### 6. Traction & Metrics (bullets)
- Revenue / ARR
- Users / customers
- Growth rate
- Unit economics (if available)

**Example:**
- 5 design partners (unpaid)
- 2 paying customers ($2K/mo each)
- Week-over-week usage: +15% (engaged users)
- CAC unknown (too early), targeting $1K CAC / $10K LTV

---

### 7. Risks (3-5 bullets, be honest)
- Product risk (does it work?)
- Market risk (is the market real?)
- Execution risk (can this team do it?)
- Competitive risk (who else is here?)
- Technical risk (does the tech scale?)

**Example:**
1. **Horizontal risk:** Sales automation is crowded. Acme needs a wedge.
2. **Voice quality:** AI voice still hit-or-miss. If prospects hang up, unit economics break.
3. **Founder risk:** Jane (CEO) has never been CEO before. Can she raise, hire, scale?
4. **Competitive:** Lavender, Instantly, Clay all adding AI features. Fast followers.
5. **Data moat:** Voice dataset is proprietary today, but hard to defend long-term.

---

### 8. Recommendation (1 paragraph)
- Invest / Pass / More Diligence
- Amount + terms
- Conditions / asks

**Example:**
> **Recommend: Invest $2M at $20M post-money, $5M round.**  
> Conditions: (1) Bring in technical co-investor for diligence on voice quality, (2) Board seat, (3) Founder vesting (4-year, 1-year cliff).  
> Why now: Category is forming. First movers with credible product will win. Jane's GTM expertise + John's ML chops = rare combo.

## Sample Deal Memo (Full 2-Page Example)

**Company:** Codex AI  
**Round:** $8M Series Seed  
**Sector:** AI-native dev tools  
**Recommendation:** **Pass (with warm follow-up)**

---

### Executive Summary
Codex AI is raising an $8M seed to build an AI coding agent that writes, tests, and deploys full features autonomously. Strong technical team (ex-Anthropic, ex-Cursor), early traction (2K GitHub stars, 200 beta users), but product is still "demo-ware" — not production-ready. **Recommend: Pass for now, revisit in 6 months when they have 10+ paying customers.** Key risk: Competitive moat unclear in a race to AGI-for-code.

---

### Company Overview
Codex AI provides an AI coding agent integrated into VSCode. Developers describe a feature in natural language, and the agent writes code, runs tests, and submits a PR. Founded in SF in Aug 2025 by 3 ex-Anthropic engineers, the team is 7 people (all eng). No revenue yet, targeting first paying customers by March 2026.

---

### Market Opportunity
The dev tools market is $40B+, and AI-native tools are displacing legacy (GitHub Copilot hit $100M ARR in <2 years). Wedge: Seed-stage startups (5-15 eng) who need to ship fast but can't afford senior devs. Catalyst: Sonnet 4.5 / o3 level models can now write multi-file features autonomously — crossing the "useful" threshold.

---

### Product & Differentiation

**What it is:**  
Codex runs in your IDE. You describe a feature ("add Stripe billing"), it generates code across multiple files, writes tests, and opens a PR. Developer reviews and merges.

**Why it wins (their claim):**  
- **Full-stack context:** Analyzes entire codebase (not just one file like Copilot)
- **Test-driven:** Writes tests first, then code to pass them
- **Autonomous:** No human in loop until PR review

**Reality check:**  
Demo is impressive, but beta users report 60% of PRs need major revisions. Not yet "autonomous" — more like "AI pair programmer++" (which is still valuable, but not a 10X leap).

---

### Team
- **Alex Chen** (CEO): Ex-Anthropic, worked on Claude Code. Strong ML + product sense.
- **Jordan Lee** (CTO): Ex-Cursor, built agentic coding features. Knows the space.
- **Sam Park** (Eng): Ex-OpenAI, infra background.

**Strengths:** Deep ML expertise, credible in AI dev tools community.  
**Gaps:** No GTM hire yet. CEO has never sold before. Risk: Build cool tech, don't know how to monetize.

---

### Traction & Metrics
- **GitHub stars:** 2,000 (organic, no paid marketing)
- **Beta users:** 200 (waitlist was 5K)
- **Paying customers:** 0 (launching paid in March 2026)
- **Usage:** 40% of beta users active weekly (decent engagement)
- **Pricing plan:** $50/user/mo (targeting $100K ARR by EOY 2026)

**Signal:** Strong developer interest, but no revenue proof yet.

---

### Risks
1. **Production-readiness:** Product works in demos, not in real codebases. 60% PR revision rate is too high.
2. **Competitive moat:** GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit, Codeium all adding agents. What's defensible?
3. **Monetization risk:** Developers love free tools, hate paying $50/mo. Conversion from free → paid unclear.
4. **OpenAI/Anthropic risk:** If Claude Code or ChatGPT Canvas add this feature, why does Codex exist?
5. **Founder risk:** No one on team has done sales/GTM. Engineering-led team may under-invest in distribution.

---

### Recommendation

**Pass (with warm follow-up in 6 months).**

**Why pass:**
- Product is not production-ready (60% revision rate too high)
- No revenue proof (can't validate $50/mo pricing)
- Competitive moat unclear — feels like a feature, not a company
- Team has no GTM experience

**Why stay warm:**
- If they hit 10+ paying customers by Q2 2026, revisit
- Strong technical team — could pivot to vertical (e.g., "AI for fintech backends")
- Developer love is real (2K GitHub stars organically is a signal)

**What would change my mind:**
- 20+ paying customers at $50/mo (proves pricing + retention)
- PR revision rate drops below 30% (proves product works)
- Hired a GTM lead (proves they can sell, not just build)

**Follow-up cadence:** Monthly check-in with Alex (CEO). If metrics improve, fast-track to partner discussion.
