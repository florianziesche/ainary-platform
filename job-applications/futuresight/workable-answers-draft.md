## Q1: Do you have previous experience co-founding and leading an early-stage product company or B2B SaaS venture?

Yes. Co-founded 36ZERO Vision (AI visual inspection SaaS, Munich, 2019–2024). CEO from day one. Wrote the first spec, hired the first engineer, closed the first customer. V1 in 6 months, first paying customer in 9. Raised +$5M, grew ACV from $240K to $1M+, team from 0 to 15. Customers: BMW, Siemens, Bosch. Full P&L, board seat.

Before that: co-founded Deutschdata (AI consulting). Learned that consulting doesn't scale.

Now building Ainary Ventures — deploying AI agent systems for SMBs, running consulting pilots to validate before productizing.

## Q2: Do you have experience building or scaling GTM workflows in B2B SaaS or SMB-focused products? Please describe your role, responsibilities, and scope.

Built the entire GTM engine at 36ZERO from zero. First 18 months I was the only salesperson. Outbound, pilot design, pricing, running paid 4-8 week pilots, converting to multi-year contracts, building channel partnerships (SAP, Bosch Rexroth, Siemens). 327% revenue growth, 9% monthly pipeline growth.

Now at Ainary I run multi-agent GTM workflows daily — lead capture, qualification, outreach, follow-up. Deploying for German SMBs with ROI tracking from week one. I grew up in a 25-employee family manufacturing business. I know how small operators evaluate tools: does it save me time this week, and can I see the ROI without a training.

Enterprise sales cycles are 6-12 months. SMB needs to convert in days. I'm building for the second.

## Q3: Do you have previous experience deploying and commercializing AI-powered products?

End-to-end. At 36ZERO: built computer vision models, deployed on production lines at BMW and Siemens, sold as recurring SaaS ($1M+ ACV). Full stack — data pipeline, model training, edge deployment, enterprise integration (SAP, MindSphere), customer success. Not a demo. These ran 24/7 on automotive lines with uptime SLAs.

Now building AI agent systems (LLMs, RAG, autonomous planning) for SMB GTM automation. I use these agents daily in my own business before deploying for clients.
