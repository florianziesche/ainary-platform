Dear Andrew,

Most associate roles are model-updating positions with a deal sourcing veneer. What caught my attention about Wingspan is that you're looking for someone who will ``actually dig in'' --- building a firm, not filling a seat. That's the only kind of work I'm interested in.

\textbf{I've been on both sides of the table.} As CEO of 36ZERO Vision, I raised \texteuro5.5M+ from institutional investors, managed P\&L in a 150-person organization, and sold enterprise AI to BMW, Siemens, and Bosch. I know what diligence looks like from the founder's seat --- the questions that surface real risk, the ones that waste time, and the signals that never show up in a data room.

\textbf{Your niche strategy is where I've been spending my research time.} I've been writing about why simple, proven business models in overlooked markets --- what you call ``alternatives to alternatives'' --- are the real AI opportunity. Manufacturing, legal services, municipal government: markets where expert knowledge is scarce, data is trapped, and incumbents can't rebuild their architectures without cannibalizing their installed base. I've published my analysis here: \href{https://publish.obsidian.md/florian-ziesche}{publish.obsidian.md/florian-ziesche}

\textbf{I can shape your internal tech stack, not just use it.} I've built production multi-agent AI systems, automated research workflows, and shipped a CNC manufacturing tool in 72 hours that incumbents quote 2--3 years to build. If Wingspan wants technology as an edge in sourcing and diligence --- I can build that.

I'm currently in VC Lab (Decile Group) and based in NYC --- happy to meet in Princeton. I'd value the chance to share a specific niche market analysis I've been developing and discuss how my operator background could accelerate Wingspan's next chapter.
