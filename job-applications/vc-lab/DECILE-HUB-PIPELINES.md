## Pipeline Definitions (from Decile Base)

- **Founders** = Deal flow. The startups you're sourcing, meeting, evaluating. This IS your investment pipeline.
- **Limited Partners** = YOUR fundraising pipeline. People who might invest in your fund. Average fund needs 250+ pitches to close.
- **Connectors** = Network amplifiers. People who send you deals, intros to LPs, open doors. Engage them regularly.
- **Confidants** = Practice your pitch with close confidants before going to real LPs. Inner circle who give honest feedback.

**Key insight from Decile:** "Cast a wide net, practice with confidants, engage connectors, then target LP archetypes that convert."
