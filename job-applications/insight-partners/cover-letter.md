**Subject:** Onsite Team — Former AI CEO who's been the founder you advise

---

Hi,

I've spent five years as the founder your Onsite team advises — scaling an enterprise AI company, closing six-figure deals with industrial giants, and figuring out GTM with a skeleton crew. Now I want to be on the other side of that table.

**WHY ME — Operator, not observer**

As MD/COO at 36ZERO Vision, I took a cloud computer vision SaaS from zero to 15+ enterprise clients — BMW, Siemens, Bosch — closing €50K–500K deals. I raised €5.5M+, managed P&L in a 150-person org, and built AI systems in production (RAG pipelines at <0.2% hallucination, multi-agent architectures, automated research workflows). I know what "do more with less" looks like because I built AI tools that replace six-figure consulting projects.

**WHY ONSITE — Not just VC**

I'm not looking for a seat on the investment team. I'm looking for the Onsite model — because the problems I solved as a founder are the same ones your portfolio companies face every day: how to land the first enterprise logos, how to build GTM motions that compound, how to ship AI products that actually work at scale. I've done technical due diligence on AI architectures, evaluated inference cost structures, and built systems where agents earn trust through verified outputs. That's portfolio support you can't hire from consulting.

**WHY INSIGHT — Scale + operating DNA**

Insight's Onsite model is singular in the industry — 90B+ AUM with an embedded operating team that doesn't just advise but builds alongside portfolio companies. That's the only version of venture that makes sense for someone with my background. My DACH enterprise network surfaces AI deals before they hit US radar, and I'm based in NYC.

I'm currently in VC Lab (Decile Group) sharpening my investment lens and building ainaryventures.com — a research platform on AI agents, trust systems, and enterprise AI adoption. Happy to share specific ideas on how I'd support Onsite portfolio companies from day one.

Best,
