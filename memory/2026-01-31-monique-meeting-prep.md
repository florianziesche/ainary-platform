## Conversation Summary

user: Read all the files and pick up where we left off.
[message_id: 54c89151-88af-4069-a1c8-12f54b24ad11]
assistant: ♔ Back online. I've got context from our first session.

**Where we are:**
- It's Friday evening (20:21 CET), you're in Schlottwitz, jetlagged
- We were supposed to do our 11 AM systems walkthrough — that got eaten by credit issues
- I was down most of the day (heartbeats kept failing)

**The clock is ticking:**

| Deadline | What | Days Left |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Feb 3 (Tue)** | Monique Barbanson meeting @ 6 PM CET | **3 days** |
| **Feb 4 (Wed)** | VC Lab Sprint 2 — all 8 deliverables | **4 days** |

**Sprint 2 status:** 0/8 complete, ~8-12h of work

**Job search status:** Zero active applications. Decile Capital Resident role is sitting there — you're literally in their program and haven't applied.

---

How do you want to play tonight? Options:

1. **Quick win** — Apply to Decile now (30-45 min, gets you on the board)
2. **Prep session** — Research Monique, outline what to show her Tuesday
3. **VC Lab grind** — Start chipping at Sprint 2 deliverables
4. **Reschedule our setup** — Do the systems walkthrough we missed

Or if you're cooked from jetlag, just tell me and we plan for tomorrow morning.
user: I would start with 2, then do 3, 4 and prepare 1 by the end of today. And send the application on Monday, after review and planning of several others.
[message_id: ef30488d-bed3-4bbe-afde-d111dab43036]
assistant: Smart sequencing. Let's go.

**Starting with Monique prep.** I'll research her deeper and then we'll outline what to show her Tuesday.
assistant: No web search (need Brave API key configured), but got LinkedIn data. Let me try her fund and a few more sources.
assistant: Crunchbase blocked, Entelechy site didn't load. But I have enough to work with. Let me compile what we know and build the meeting strategy.

## Monique Barbanson — Meeting Brief

**When:** Tuesday Feb 3, 6 PM CET (12 PM NYC)  
**Format:** She wants to see how you use AI — this is a "show me your workflow" session

### Who She Is

| | |
|---|---|
| **Current** | Angel Investor → B2B AI-native startups (Data Infra, Applied AI) |
| **Fund** | Entelechy Ventures (Venture Fellow @ Venture Institute) |
| **Education** | MS CS (AI) from Yale — she's technical |
| **Career** | 20 years Enterprise Data & AI, ex-Microsoft, ex-Affirm |
| **Patents** | Video streaming optimization, UI/UX content legibility |
| **Founded** | Startup Monthly (2009-2011) — accelerator teaching Lean Startup |

### What Makes Her Tick

- **Deeply technical** — Yale CS/AI, holds patents, not a finance-first VC
- **Operator background** — Built products at Microsoft, understands the trenches
- **Lean Startup DNA** — Taught customer discovery, values iteration over perfection
- **AI thesis** — Invests in AI-native B2B, data infrastructure, applied AI

### Why She's Interested

She saw your GPT on WhatsApp in VC Lab. That's unusual — most people talk about AI, you *live* in it. She wants to see the behind-the-scenes.

---

## Meeting Strategy

### The Frame

This isn't a pitch meeting. It's a **"show your thinking"** session. She's curious about your AI workflow. That's your superpower — the compound system you've built.

**Goal:** Impress her with *how* you work, not *what* you've built. The Legal AI platform can come up naturally if relevant, but don't force it.

### What to Show Her

**1. The Stack (2-3 min overview)**
- OpenClaw/Atlas (me) as the orchestration layer
- How memory compounds across sessions
- Notion + Obsidian integration
- Multi-channel access (WhatsApp, Telegram, web)

**2. Live Demo: A Real Workflow (5-7 min)**

Options — pick one that feels natural:
- **Research task** — "Atlas, research [fund X]" → show how I pull data, structure it, save to memory
- **Content creation** — Show how a blog post goes from idea → outline → draft → social variants
- **Job search support** — How I prep interview briefs, track pipeline, follow up

**3. The Philosophy (conversation)**
- Why you built this: 100x leverage, compound advantage
- How it changes how you work vs. "just using ChatGPT"
- What's still broken / where it's heading

### Talking Points for Her Interests

| Her Interest | Your Angle |
|--------------|------------|
| AI-native B2B | You're building an AI-native workflow for yourself — same principles apply to products |
| Technical depth | You can go deep on RAG, agent architectures, memory systems |
| Lean Startup | Your system is iterative — you ship, learn, compound |
| Data infrastructure | Your workspace *is* a personal data layer — Notion, Obsidian, memory files |

### Questions to Ask Her

1. "What patterns are you seeing in the AI-native B2B deals you're evaluating?"
2. "What separates the best AI founders you've backed from the rest?"
3. "How do you think about AI tooling for VC workflows specifically?"
4. "What's your thesis on where applied AI creates the most value in enterprise?"

### Potential Outcomes

- **Best case:** She's impressed, connects you to portfolio companies or other VCs
- **Good case:** She shares insights on AI investing, becomes a warm contact
- **Bonus:** She asks about Legal AI Platform — that's a signal she sees deal potential

**Does this framing feel right?** Anything you want to add or adjust before we move to VC Lab Sprint 2?
user: Do work for me that matters, do not stop. I will be gone for the next 1 hour. I will answer you in 1 to 1.5 hours.
[message_id: 86823c6f-6278-4ba5-aa75-a33782b73b3e]
assistant: Got it. I'll work autonomously and have deliverables ready when you're back.

**Plan for the next hour:**
1. ✅ Save Monique meeting brief
2. Fetch Decile job posting → draft application
3. Sprint 2: Knock out what I can (terminology, secret sauce, thought leadership draft)
4. Sprint 2: Research NYC VC ecosystem via web_fetch where possible
5. Update daily notes with progress

Starting now. See you in ~1 hour.
assistant: Now tackling Sprint 2. Starting with deliverables I can complete, then researching what I can.
assistant: Now let me research the NYC VC ecosystem for Step 1. I'll try to pull data from specific sources.
assistant: Web fetch hitting walls on VC list pages. I'll compile what I know and create a research framework. Let me also check if I can find AI-focused VCs specifically.
assistant: Let me check what else I can prepare and create a summary for when you return.
assistant: All set. Here's the summary for when you're back:

1. Share your resume → I'll tailor it for Decile
2. Review cover letter → submit Decile application
3. Plan 2 more applications together

What do you want to tackle first?
user: have a look at the kanban.md first, then the sprint (while I am still fresh) and then review the meeting brief and job applications. Lastly I want to learn about the best way to feed you with information, like my past learnings, to use that knowledge as improved basis fpr compounding knowledge and better outcomes.
[message_id: c4e665fe-0c2d-4b5b-aa6d-992ae596f899]
assistant: Let's go. Starting with KANBAN.
