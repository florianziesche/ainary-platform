# 2026-02-04 Evening Session — 36ZERO Report v1.2 + LaTeX Migration

## Key Events

### 36ZERO Strategic Report v1.2
- Florian requested updates: Pharma section condensed (3→1), timelines removed from Top 3 Moves, sources in research-paper format (2-column compact), Version 1.2 label, email changed to florian@ainaryventures.com
- Added 4 NEW pages: TAM/SAM/SOM waterfall ($41.7B→$5.2B→$120-350M), Competitive Deep Dive (feature matrix 5 competitors), Revenue Scenarios (3 paths), Risk Matrix (8 risks)
- Report grew from 11 to 15 pages

### HTML Layout Failures (CRITICAL LEARNING)
- **4 iterations of HTML-to-PDF all had layout bugs**: content overlapping footers (pages 5, 7), inconsistent margins, footer positioning issues, line spacing problems
- Florian repeatedly said "Design hat nicht gestimmt" despite multiple CSS fixes
- Root cause: Chrome headless --print-to-pdf does NOT reliably handle page breaks, footer positioning, or content overflow
- **DECISION: Switch to LaTeX (XeLaTeX) for all future reports**

### LaTeX Setup
- TinyTeX installed at ~/Library/TinyTeX/ (no sudo needed)
- PATH: `$HOME/Library/TinyTeX/bin/universal-darwin`
- MacTeX was installed via brew but pkg not actually installed (needs sudo)
- Required packages installed: fontspec, geometry, xcolor, fancyhdr, titlesec, tabularx, booktabs, tikz, tcolorbox, multicol, etc.
- tikzfill package was missing initially → installed separately
- multicol package was missing → added to document

### LaTeX Report Compiled Successfully
- 16 pages, 0 errors
- Font: Helvetica Neue (system font via fontspec)
- Some Overfull hbox warnings (fixed stat-card width 4.8→4.6cm, ruleitem proportions)
- Template saved at: `research/36zero-report.tex`

### Report Design Skill Rewritten
- `skills/report-design/SKILL.md` completely rewritten
- **Golden Rule: ALWAYS LaTeX, NEVER HTML-to-PDF**
- Added Pre-Flight Checklist (5 sections, ~20 checkpoints)
- Added LaTeX component library (statcard, highlightbox, darkhighlight, ruleitem, tables)
- Added standard packages list and geometry settings
- Documented all feedback from today's iterations

### Feedback System + Sub-Agent Playbook Created
- `agents/FEEDBACK-SYSTEM.md` — template for every task (optimal outcome, criteria, feedback routing)
- `agents/SUBAGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` — crash analysis, spawn rules (max 3 sequential, focused tasks)
- `skills/report-design/SKILL.md` — report-specific feedback log

## Decisions
- **LaTeX > HTML for PDFs** — non-negotiable going forward
- **florian@ainaryventures.com** as contact email (not florianziesche.com)
- **Cover stats in same language as report** (no mixed DE/EN)
- **Sources as research-paper format** — compact 2-column numbered references
- **Pre-Flight Checklist mandatory** before showing any PDF to Florian

## Files Created/Modified
- `research/36zero-report.tex` — NEW LaTeX template (primary going forward)
- `skills/report-design/SKILL.md` — REWRITTEN with LaTeX focus
- `agents/FEEDBACK-SYSTEM.md` — NEW
- `agents/SUBAGENT-PLAYBOOK.md` — NEW (created earlier in session)
- `research/36zero-report.html` — Modified (v1.2 changes, but deprecated for PDF)
- `research/36zero-report-en.html` — Modified (v1.2 changes, but deprecated for PDF)

## Open Items
- EN LaTeX version not yet created (only DE)
- Overfull hbox fixes need final verification (session interrupted during recompile)
- Report not yet shared with Heiko Huber
- Florian's last request: "gib dir selbst eine Anweisung" → SKILL.md rewritten
