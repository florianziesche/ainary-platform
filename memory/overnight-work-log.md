# Overnight Work Log

*Work completed by Atlas while Florian sleeps.*

---

## Session: 2026-02-02 (Monday 08:00 AM CET)

### Context
- Today is Monday Feb 2
- **Monique meeting TOMORROW** (Feb 3, 18:00 CET) — critical
- Sprint 2 due Feb 4 (2 days)
- Decile application ready for Monday submission
- LinkedIn post ready for Feb 3 (14:00 CET)

---

### ✅ Completed Work

#### 1. Monique Meeting Day-Of Checklist ✅ NEW
**File:** `vc-lab/monique-meeting-day-of-checklist.md`

Created comprehensive checklist for Feb 3:
- Morning prep tasks (test OpenClaw, check LinkedIn)
- Afternoon setup (tabs, lighting, camera)
- Pre-call readiness (17:30-17:55)
- Demo ready items and fallback plans
- Post-call follow-up tasks (30 min window)
- Mindset reminders

**Why this matters:** Meeting brief and demo script are excellent, but execution details matter. This ensures nothing is forgotten day-of.

---

#### 2. MEMORY.md Consolidation ✅
**File:** `MEMORY.md`

Updated with:
- Active threads status (all prep items for Monique meeting now marked complete)
- Expanded Monique profile (Yale CS/AI, Microsoft/Affirm background, Lean Startup DNA)
- New lessons learned (LinkedIn timing, Brave API missing, Obsidian sync patterns)
- LinkedIn post timing added to threads

---

#### 3. Research Attempted (Limited by Tools)

**Web search:** Blocked — Brave API key not configured
**Web fetch:** Limited success — LinkedIn returns 999, some sites block scraping

**Recommendation:** Configure Brave API key for future sessions:
```bash
openclaw configure --section web
```
