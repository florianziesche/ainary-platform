---

## Session: 2026-02-01 (Sunday 12:09 PM Berlin / 6:09 AM NYC)

### Context
- Florian in Germany, jetlagged
- Sprint 2 due Feb 4 (3 days)
- Monique meeting Feb 3 (2 days)
- Decile application ready for Monday submission

---

### ✅ Completed Work

#### 1. HOF Capital Fund Research Brief
**File:** `fund-research/hof-capital-brief.md`

Deep dive on HOF Capital as a target fund:
- Full thesis breakdown ("March to Abundance")
- Team structure (all partners, investors, operations)
- Portfolio analysis (SpaceX, Neuralink, Databricks, Crusoe AI, etc.)
- AI focus assessment — strong fit for Florian
- Networking approach with specific people to target
- Cold outreach angle drafted

**Why HOF:** Multi-stage firm with explicit AI thesis, values technical founders with "outlier traits," 200+ LP network, NYC-based. Good target for operator-to-VC transition.

---

#### 2. LinkedIn Post Drafts
**File:** `content-drafts/linkedin-post-ai-native-operator.md`

Four draft options:
1. **The Compound AI Stack** — Personal setup reveal
2. **The VC Evaluation Gap** — Technical + business combo
3. **The Building vs Shipping Trap** — Vulnerable/honest angle
4. **AI Agents as Employees** — Thought leadership (recommended)

Ready for Florian to review and post. Option 4 aligns best with AI & Work content pillar.

---

#### 3. Job Search Reconnaissance
- Checked Decile Group Lever — no current openings listed
- Checked FirstMark Ashby — no roles visible
- Web search limited by missing Brave API key
- **Action needed:** Register events from Step 6 to network into roles

---

### 📋 Recommendations for Today (Sunday)

**Must Do:**
1. Review Decile cover letter — add contact info, finalize for Monday send
2. Pick a LinkedIn post draft and publish (Sunday afternoon is good timing)
3. Register for NYU Law Legal Tech Demo Day (Feb 5) — your Legal AI Platform is directly relevant

**Should Do:**
4. Review Step 5 (Secret Sauce) and add your specific examples
5. Finalize any rough edges on Sprint 2 before Monday crunch

**Nice to Have:**
6. Follow HOF Capital team on LinkedIn, engage with posts
7. Prep any additional questions for Monique meeting (brief is ready)
