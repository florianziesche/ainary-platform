## 2026 Outlook

### Funding Expectations
- **+10-25%** vs 2025

### Where Capital Concentrates

**Winners:**
1. **Foundation Models** — Continued mega-rounds

3. **Vertical AI** — Deep workflow integration required
4. **Defense Tech** — Geopolitical tailwinds
5. **Robotics** — "Physical AI" inflection point
6. **Healthcare AI** — Provider margin pressure

**Losers:**
- Climate Tech (long cycles, patient capital)
- Crypto (soured after 2025 price drops)
- Vertical SaaS without AI differentiation
- "AI Wrappers" — Shift already happened

## Key Themes

### 1. "Fundamentals-First Year"

> — Anders Ranum, Sapphire Ventures

### 2. Bifurcation
- Winners: AI-native companies getting bigger rounds
- Losers: Everyone else struggling to raise
- "Tale of two cities" — Scale and domain expertise matter

### 3. Liquidity Returning
- IPO volumes up 20%, proceeds up 84%
- M&A up 40% YoY
- Secondaries: $160B (2024) → $210B+ (2025)
- "Down-round IPOs" now acceptable

### 4. "Bar is Rising"
> "Founders must prove to VCs they have more than just traction; they need a distribution moat"

## Fund Thesis Ideas (Ainary Ventures)

Based on trends:
1. **Vertical AI** — Deep industry integration
2. **Agentic Infrastructure** — Tools for building agents
3. **AI-Native SaaS** — Not wrappers, but rebuilt products
4. **Defense/Industrial AI** — Underserved, growing

Anti-thesis:
- Avoid: Generic AI wrappers
- Avoid: SaaS without AI differentiation
- Avoid: Consumer without distribution
