## Mia's Self-Assessment

**Quality Check:**
- CNC research: ✅ Actionable, prioritized, ROI-calculated
- Article polish: ✅ Publication-ready, no further edits needed
- VC research: ✅ High-priority leads identified, clear next steps

**Execution Focus:**
- Built pipeline, not just ideas
- Everything has next steps for Florian
- ROI calculated for decision-making
- No "mental notes" — all documented

**What I'd Do Differently:**
- Rate-limited on web search (hit Brave API limit) — should have paced searches better
- Could have extracted contact emails directly from CNC websites (would save Florian 1-2 hours)
- VC research could go deeper on fund theses (but time-boxed correctly for overnight session)

**Confidence Level:** 85%
- CNC leads: High confidence (good regional distribution, pain point match)
- Article: Very high confidence (publication-ready)
- VC leads: Medium-high confidence (need to verify job descriptions, but strong targets)
