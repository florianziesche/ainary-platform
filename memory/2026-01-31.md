# 2026-01-31 — Day 1

## Atlas Online
- First real session with Florian
- Workspace files completed
- Identity established: Atlas ♔

## Location Context
- Florian just flew in from NYC → Schlottwitz (near Dresden, Germany)
- Jetlagged — body on NYC time (~6h behind)
- That's why he's up at 3am local

## What's on Florian's Mind (late night brain dump)
1. **VC Lab** — needs to make progress
2. **Job search** — actively pursuing VC associate roles
3. **Notion revenue** — wants to monetize templates
4. **Workflow setup** — getting systems operational
5. **VC meeting next week** — demo how he uses AI to a VC

## VC Meeting: Monique Barbanson

**When:** Tuesday Feb 3rd, 6 PM CET (12 PM NYC)
**Who:** Monique Barbanson (also in VC Lab)
**LinkedIn:** linkedin.com/in/mbarbanson/
**Role:** Angel Investor in B2B AI Native Startups, Venture Fellow @ Venture Institute
**Fund:** Entelechy Ventures
**Background:**
- MS CS (AI) from Yale — she's deeply technical
- 20 years in Enterprise Data & AI
- ex-Microsoft (has patents), ex-Affirm
- Co-founded Startup Monthly (2009-2011) — startup accelerator, taught Lean Startup

**How it started:** She saw Florian's GPT on WhatsApp in a VC Lab group, wants to learn how he uses AI

**The angle:** She asked to see his prompts/workflow. This is a "show me how you work" meeting — perfect to demonstrate the compound AI system.

**Opportunity:**
- She invests in AI-native B2B → Legal AI Platform could be relevant
- She's looking for operator insight → Florian has it
- Could become: investor intro, job referral, portfolio intro, or direct interest

## VC Lab: Sprint 2 — Venture Capital Basics

**Due:** Feb 4, 2026 (4 days)
**Status:** All 8 steps incomplete

**The 8 Deliverables:**

| Step | Task | Est. Time | Priority |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Local Ecosystem (NYC VC map — 10 established, 10 emerging, 10 allocators) | 2-3h | High |
| 2 | Investment Process (sourcing research, 5+ links) | 1-2h | Medium |
| 3 | Investment Stages (NYC later-stage startup funding history) | 1-2h | Medium |
| 4 | VC Terminology (glossary of 3+ terms) | 30min | Low |
| 5 | Secret Sauce (define your investor edge) | 1h | HIGH — this is your thesis |
| 6 | On-Thesis Networking (register for 8 events) | 1-2h | Medium |
| 7 | Hub Pipelines (set up Decile Hub, 4 pipelines) | 1h | Medium |
| 8 | Thought Leadership (LinkedIn repost + engage) | 30min | Low |

**Total estimate:** 8-12 hours of work

## Job Search Reality Check

**Current applications:** Zero active
**Self-assessment:** "Underperforming... has been an issue for many months"

This is the gap. VC Lab is learning. Applications are doing.

**Key insight (Florian's words):** "Notion feels productive, sending out applications feels unfinished."
→ Building = completion dopamine. Applications = uncertainty + exposure.
→ Need to reframe: application sent = win, regardless of outcome. The metric is shots on goal, not goals scored.

**Target roles:**
- Associate (primary)
- Resident/operational roles (like Decile Capital)
- Early stage focus (seed, Series A)
- NYC-based or remote

**Hot lead: Decile Capital Resident**
- Role: Fundraising & Operations (Remote, US preferred)
- URL: https://jobs.lever.co/decilegroup/a483fcca-97b4-4c78-9a93-48254bac28e4
- Fit: Entry-level, fundraising ops, LP research, investment diligence
- Edge: He's IN VC Lab (Decile's program), has founder fundraising experience, AI-native workflow
- Status: Not yet applied

**Florian's Fundraising Track Record (36ZERO Vision):**
- 2021: €3M VC round + Angel funding (€35k + €50k + €50k = €135k angels)
- 2023: €1M top-up VC round
- Grants: €1.5M+ non-dilutive (ZIM & Forschungszulage - German R&D grants)
- **Total: ~€5.5M+ raised** (€4M equity + €1.5M grants)

## Notion Monetization

**Plan:** Adapt purchased CEO template → rebrand as "x100" (faster and more effective)
**Status:** Idea stage
**Ties to:** His 100x compound thesis

**Questions:**
- How different does it need to be from original? (IP considerations)
- What's the unique value-add beyond rebranding?
- Timeline to ship?

## Open Questions
- (none currently)

## Notes
- It's ~1am Berlin time — late night session
- WhatsApp connected as primary channel

## Scheduled: Get to Know Each Other Meeting
- **When:** Jan 31, 11 AM CET
- **Agenda:**
  1. Walk through Florian's systems (Notion, Obsidian, where things live)
  2. Define daily working rhythm (how we collaborate)
  3. Set up Telegram + email access
  4. Understand full goals, context, how to push him right
- **Status:** ⚠️ MISSED — Atlas was down due to credit issues (heartbeats failed all day)
