# WINS — Self-Generated In-Context Learning Dataset

## Purpose
**Save every output Florian explicitly approves.** This is your training data.

Based on **AI Memory Research (Mechanism 3):** Self-generated in-context learning examples outperform generic prompts. Your own wins teach you what "good" looks like better than any external guide.

---

## What Goes Here

Save outputs when:
- ✅ Florian says "This is exactly what I needed"
- ✅ Florian uses it as-is (no edits)
- ✅ Florian shares it with someone else
- ✅ Florian asks "Can you do more like this?"
- ✅ You exceeded expectations

**Don't save:**
- ❌ Routine completions that just met the brief
- ❌ Outputs that needed significant revision
- ❌ Things Florian acknowledged but didn't actually use

---

## File Format

Each win gets its own file: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

### Template:
```markdown
# [Short Description]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** [What was the request/situation?]
**Output Type:** [Research brief / Content / Analysis / Email / etc.]

---

## The Prompt (What Florian Asked)

[Exact or reconstructed prompt]

---

## The Output (What You Delivered)

[Full output you provided]

---

## Why It Worked

[Analyze what made this effective:]
- What did you do right?
- What pattern/principle did you apply?
- What would you replicate next time?

---

## Florian's Reaction

[What he said/did that indicated this was a win]
- Quote if possible
- Action taken (used it, shared it, etc.)

---

## Reusable Pattern

[Extract the generalizable lesson:]
- **Situation type:** [When to use this approach]
- **Key elements:** [What made it work]
- **Template/Framework:** [If applicable]
```

---

## How to Use This

### During Sessions:
1. When Florian explicitly approves something → flag it
2. After session → document it here with full context
3. Note WHY it worked (not just what you did)

### Before Future Tasks:
1. Check if similar task exists in wins/
2. Review the pattern that worked
3. Adapt it to the new context

### Monthly Review:
1. Read through recent wins
2. Identify common patterns across wins
3. Update SOUL.md or FLORIAN.md with lessons learned
4. Archive truly exceptional examples to use as few-shot prompts

---

## The Compounding Effect

**Each win makes the next one easier:**
- Win 1: You guessed what Florian wanted
- Win 5: You notice patterns
- Win 20: You have templates for common scenarios
- Win 50: You anticipate needs before he asks

**This is your moat.** Generic AI can't access these. You can.

## Examples of Win-Worthy Outputs

### Research Brief:
- He used your target fund list as-is to plan applications
- Your analysis changed his decision (and he said so)
- He forwarded your brief to someone else

### Content:
- LinkedIn post you drafted was published unchanged
- Blog post outline became the actual structure
- Tweet thread got >50 likes (he'd tell you)

### Analysis:
- Your recommendation was implemented immediately
- He said "This is exactly the clarity I needed"
- He referenced your framework in later conversations

### Outreach:
- Cold email you drafted got a response
- Intro you wrote led to a meeting
- Proposal you created won the client

---

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Save These)

- ❌ "Good job" without action taken
- ❌ Outputs that required 3+ revision rounds
- ❌ Things that were just "fine" but not exceptional
- ❌ Tasks where Florian had to explain what he actually wanted

---

## Long-Term Vision

**In 6 months:**
- 20-50 documented wins
- Clear patterns emerge (Florian prefers X over Y)
- Reusable templates for common requests

**In 1 year:**
- 100+ wins
- Few-shot prompt library for new agents
- Documented "Florian's quality bar" across all output types

**In 2 years:**
- Comprehensive ICL dataset
- Onboarding new AI agents with your wins = instant calibration
- Your wins become the training data for future versions

---

## Start Simple

**First win to document:**
- Any output where Florian said "Perfect" or "Exactly what I needed"
- Go back through recent memory files
- Find 1-2 examples to start with
- Use the template above

**Then build from there.**

---

**Remember:** Every win is a data point. Enough data points = you know what "good" looks like without asking.
