## HOF CV v3 Iteration (02:44-03:15)

**Decision:** UPDATE  
**Confidence:** high  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/projects.md` → VC Job Applications section  
**Reason:** Significant CV changes that affect application readiness. Details about email, LinkedIn URL, currency conversions are decision points that matter for future applications.  
**Content:** Added CV v3 specifics: email change (ainaryventures→gmail), LinkedIn URL needs setup, EUR→USD conversions, $5M vs $5.5M decision, structural changes (VC Lab, Advisor, 36ZERO split)  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## HOF CV v3 Finalization (01:30-02:10)

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** This is a duplicate/continuation of the previous section. Details already captured in the UPDATE above. The VC CV Playbook insights and Board Advisor feedback are ephemeral context for that specific iteration.

---

## CNC Planer Pro: Neue Anfrage (04:17)

**Decision:** UPDATE  
**Confidence:** high  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/contacts.md` → Andreas Brand section  
**Reason:** Andreas requested real praxistest with actual Lagerungstraverse part - this is a status change and material details that matter for ongoing relationship.  
**Content:** Updated with drawing number, material specs (GJS-700, ~2095mm), material cost (€1,200), calculation results (661 min, €19,730/piece), email draft status  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## CNC Planner Pro v2.0 erstellt (04:19-04:24)

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** v2.0 was superseded by v18 and v19 in same session. Intermediate versions don't need memory persistence. Final v19 details are what matter.

---

## CNC Planner v18 Session (04:00-05:00)

**Decision:** UPDATE (consolidated into v19)  
**Confidence:** high  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/projects.md` → CNC Planner Pro section  
**Reason:** v18 was the base for v19. Key features and bug fixes need to be captured, but consolidated into final v19 status.  
**Content:** Integrated v18 features (AI-Assistent Panel, Werker-fragen Button, critical bug fixes) into comprehensive v19 description  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Session 2 (04:00-09:15) — CNC Planner v18 + Reports

**Decision:** NOOP (mostly)  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** CNC v18 already captured above. Reports (Risikoanalyse, Mittelstand Problem) are ephemeral deliverables, not persistent knowledge. Telegram integration detail is ephemeral (chat ID already known).

**Sub-Decision:** UPDATE  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/contacts.md` → Nancy  
**Reason:** Nancy context (Gepäck, Zugticket, Witz gesendet) shows relationship management pattern and current status  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Session 3 (09:25-10:15) — Morning Brief + Feedback Loop

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** Morning brief content is ephemeral. Feedback loop system (Kintsugi, A/B/C output rule) already exists in procedural memory (anti-patterns.md, output-delivery.md). Research completion and plugin installation are status updates not needing long-term memory.

**Sub-Decision:** UPDATE  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/technical-setup.md`  
**Reason:** Smart Connections plugin installation is a tool configuration change that persists  
**Content:** Added Smart Connections v4.1.8, settings, activation status  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Session 4 (10:00-10:35) — OpenClaw Update + Research

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** OpenClaw already on latest (no action needed), Nancy joke is ephemeral interaction, feedback loop already documented, research completion is status not knowledge.

**Sub-Decision:** UPDATE  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/technical-setup.md`  
**Reason:** SOTA Paper Scanner cron job is persistent infrastructure  
**Content:** Added cron job details (schedule, session ID, first run results)  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Session 5 (10:42-10:50) — Paper Deep Dive + Obsidian

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** medium  
**Reason:** Paper batch status is ephemeral (tasks in progress). CNC Planner time output is already in calculation procedural memory. Obsidian settings recommendations are advisory, not persistent config.

---

## Session 6 (10:49-10:55) — PDF + Paper Status

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** PDF delivery is ephemeral deliverable. Paper batch statuses are task progress, not knowledge.

---

## SOTA Research Synthese (10:55)

**Decision:** ADD  
**Confidence:** high  
**Target:** NEW FILE: `memory/semantic/experiments.md`  
**Reason:** This is HIGH-VALUE persistent knowledge. The 3 Universal Laws, cross-learnings, paper findings, and action items will be relevant for months/years. This is exactly the kind of research insight that should persist.  
**Content:** Created comprehensive experiments.md with agent calibration results, vault gold findings, SOTA synthesis, 3 Universal Laws, novel findings, key papers  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Session 7 (11:00-11:15) — Action Items + Cron

**Decision:** UPDATE  
**Confidence:** high  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/decisions.md`  
**Reason:** Memory restructure proposal (episodic/semantic/procedural) is a strategic architectural decision. Fertigungsverfassung (Constitutional AI for CNC) is a validated pattern. These are decision-level insights.  
**Content:** Added Decision 9 (Multi-Lens Research Pattern), Decision 10 (Agent Persona Calibration), Decision 11 (Three Universal Laws)  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

**Sub-Decision:** ADD  
**Target:** NEW FILE: `memory/procedural/research-methodology.md`  
**Reason:** Multi-lens research, agent calibration, convergence/divergence framework are PROCESSES that will be reused. This is procedural knowledge.  
**Content:** Created comprehensive research methodology documentation  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Backlog — Obsidian RAG Verbesserungen

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** This is a TODO list, not knowledge. PaperQA2 status already captured in technical-setup.md.

---

## CNC Planner v18 Kalkulations-Check (11:37)

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** Bug identification (Materialpreis) was fixed in v19. The check itself is ephemeral QA work.

---

## PaperQA2 — Geparkt

**Decision:** UPDATE  
**Confidence:** high  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/technical-setup.md`  
**Reason:** Decision to park PaperQA2 due to API limits is a tool status change that prevents future confusion ("why aren't we using this?")  
**Content:** Added PaperQA2 status: parked, reason (OpenAI Tier 1 limit), alternative (Smart Connections)  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Smart Connections

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** medium  
**Reason:** Pro version clarification is advisory. Multilingual E5 recommendation is Florian's decision to activate, not persistent config yet.

---

## CNC Planner v19 — Alle Features (12:10)

**Decision:** UPDATE  
**Confidence:** high  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/projects.md` → CNC Planner Pro  
**Reason:** v19 is the FINAL presentation-ready version. Comprehensive feature list, bug fixes, demo status with Andreas, business model - all persistent knowledge needed for future sessions.  
**Content:** Replaced v18 description with complete v19 feature set, technical details, Andreas praxistest status, known issues, file locations  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Nachmittag (12:15-14:00) — v19 Bug-Fixes & Polish

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** Bug fixes are already incorporated into v19 description above. Print fixes, nested sections bug, showSection rewrite - these are implementation details, not knowledge. Nancy iMessage (NO_REPLY) and Downloads cleanup are ephemeral.

---

## Late Afternoon (16:30-17:00) — Andreas Praxistest

**Decision:** ALREADY CAPTURED  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** Andreas praxistest details already updated in contacts.md earlier. Florian availability context is short-term status.

**Sub-Decision:** UPDATE  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/florian-profile.md` → Work Context  
**Reason:** "Floriana hat kein Kita, Eltern arbeiten" explains limited availability - this context helps understand Florian's capacity constraints for planning.  
**Content:** Added current situation (limited availability, evening work, research-heavy day capacity)  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Franziska (+4916096369329)

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** Unresolved question ("Was hat sie geschrieben?") without context. No persistent information to store yet.

---

## The Mia Experiment — Agent Calibration (17:20-17:45)

**Decision:** ALREADY CAPTURED  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** Agent calibration experiment comprehensive results already added to experiments.md. Blog post draft is content pipeline work (already in projects.md content section).

**Sub-Decision:** UPDATE  
**Target:** `memory/semantic/projects.md` → Content Strategy  
**Reason:** Two content pieces (Done Gap article + Mia Experiment) are specific deliverables at specific stages - worth tracking  
**Content:** Added "Your AI Agent Lies About Being Done" (ready to publish tonight) and "The Mia Experiment" (in development) with status details  
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED

---

## Abend-Session (17:45-18:10) — Vault Gold Experiment

**Decision:** ALREADY CAPTURED  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** Vault Gold experiment results (5 agents × 5 lenses) already comprehensively documented in experiments.md. Convergence/divergence findings are the key persistent knowledge.

---

## Research Deep Dive — 3 Hypothesen (18:14-18:25)

**Decision:** ALREADY CAPTURED  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** All three hypotheses (H1 Curated Memory, H2 Done Gap, H3 Meta-Skills) validation results already in experiments.md with evidence, key papers, and open questions.

---

## Manifesto + Artikel-Plan (18:24-18:26)

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** MANIFESTO.md is an internal doc (created in workspace), not memory. Article plan is content pipeline (covered in projects.md). Key findings index is reference for tonight's writing, not persistent knowledge.

---

## Abend-Updates (18:26-18:34)

**Decision:** NOOP  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** Manifesto rewrite is workspace doc change. Substack draft is deliverable (already in projects.md). INDEX.md rule reinforcement is already in hard-rules.md and MEMORY.md.

---

## MEGA Research Session — 31 Papers (18:48-18:58)

**Decision:** ALREADY CAPTURED  
**Confidence:** high  
**Reason:** MEGA-SYNTHESIS with 3 Universal Laws, novel findings, category insights, and Florian's questions all comprehensively captured in experiments.md. This is the crown jewel of today's research.

## Key Insights from This Analysis

1. **High Signal Day:** 2026-02-10 was exceptionally research-heavy with multiple experiments producing persistent insights (3 Universal Laws, agent calibration, vault analysis)

2. **Version Consolidation Pattern:** CNC Planner went through v2→v18→v19 in one day. Only v19 (final presentation version) needed memory persistence.

3. **Research > Execution:** Florian's availability was limited (Floriana no Kita), so day focused on research/experiments rather than sending/shipping - validated the 5/5 agent convergence finding.

4. **Memory Restructure Validated:** Today's work demonstrates WHY episodic/semantic/procedural separation matters - semantic holds persistent facts, procedural holds reusable methods, episodic (daily log) captures flow.

5. **Aggressive NOOP Discipline:** 18/28 sections (64%) were correctly identified as ephemeral - validates the "be aggressive about NOOPs" instruction.
