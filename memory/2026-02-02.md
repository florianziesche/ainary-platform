## Lessons / Notes

1. **Kanban Plugin** — Can't install remotely, but file format is ready. Florian just needs to enable community plugins in Obsidian.

2. **Google Drive** — Needs OAuth setup. Florian has to run:
   ```bash
   gog auth credentials /path/to/client_secret.json
   gog auth add florian@email.com --services gmail,calendar,drive
   ```

3. **System Philosophy** — Documented the three-system approach (Obsidian for thinking, Notion for structure, OpenClaw for operations) to prevent duplication.
