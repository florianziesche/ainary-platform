### SOTA Research Applied (~01:00)
- **AgentAuditor → Sub-Agent Quality Gate**: Added reflection pattern to AGENTS.md. Every sub-agent must self-audit before completing. Targets the ~20% error rate.
- **Memory-R1 → Evening Distillation**: Updated Evening Review cron with "Store only what changes future behavior in 30 days" principle.
- **Cron autonomy blocked**: Added rule that crons MUST NOT modify SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md autonomously.
- **AIRS-Bench**: Potential framework for benchmarking our own research agent quality. Not implemented yet.
- **9 Agentic Patterns (Beam.ai)**: We use Router-Specialist + ReAct. Need: Planner-Critic-Executor + Reflection Loop. Don't need: Tree of Thoughts, LATS, ReWOO, Debate.

### Morning Session (~08:00-09:30)

**Reports AR-033 to AR-040 Status:**
- AR-033 to AR-037: ✅ Done (completed overnight)
- AR-038 (Costs): ✅ Done (3rd attempt succeeded, CPUO framework)
- AR-039 (Pipeline): Still running
- AR-040 (Evolution): ✅ Done
- All 8 PDFs generated via browser→PDF and sent to Florian via Telegram

**VC Pipeline Research Done:**
- 50 AI-focused funds researched, output: `research/inbox/vc-pipeline-50-funds-2026-02-17.md`
- Top matches: Glasswing (Agent Autonomy Framework), Radical ($1.8B), Earlybird/HV/La Famiglia (Munich network), Conviction (Sarah Guo), Nyca (NYC, active posting)
- NEW finds: FutureSight Ventures (EIR NYC, active hiring), Seligman Ventures ($500M AI fund launched Feb 12!), Innovate.VC (EIR program)
- 5 cold outreach drafts written, waiting for Florian to send

**Python Research Pipeline Built:**
- `projects/research-pipeline/pipeline.py` — Multi-model routing (Haiku extract → Sonnet synthesize → Opus write)
- ~$1.34 per report, $200 budget = ~149 reports
- anthropic package installed, 3 example reports pre-configured (AR-041 to AR-043)
- Needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var

**Architecture Changes Implemented:**
- `SUB-AGENT-CONTEXT.md` created (1.4KB) — shared context for all sub-agents (decisions, design system, priorities)
- AGENTS.md updated: Typed Memory (MIRIX-inspired), Memory-R1 STORE/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP rules
- Evening Review cron updated with Memory-R1 protocol

**Report Quality Issue Identified:**
- AR-033 to AR-040 have degraded quality vs AR-001/002
- Root cause: Sub-agents = one-shot, no iterative review, no design system access
- Apple emojis crept into HTML, CSS drift, font inconsistencies
- QA sub-agent spawned to fix all reports
- Future fix: `report-template.html` with placeholders, design compliance in quality gate

**Obsidian Cleanup Started:**
- 488 → 383 active files
- Archived: 40_People (duplicate), root orphans, _NAV/_Index boilerplate
- Ordner-für-Ordner review started with Florian (Freie-Presse-KI pending decision)

**Cron Bloat Alert:**
- Back to 21 cron jobs (was consolidated to 8, crept back up to 21)
- Need second consolidation pass

**WhatsApp Gateway:**
- 15+ disconnects today (408 status), auto-reconnects each time
- Monitoring but not actionable yet

**Key Insight from Report Read-Through:**
The 5 architecture changes needed: (1) Typed Memory, (2) Sub-Agent Shared Context, (3) Memory-R1, (4) Context Priority Pinning, (5) CPUO Dashboard. Implemented #2 and #3 today. #1 documented in AGENTS.md. #4 and #5 still TODO.

## "Why I Built This" — Website Copy Session (~10:15-11:45)

**Iteration process:** Florian wrote raw text → Mia refined → Florian expanded → cycle repeated 5+ times. Key tension: Florian keeps adding ideas while writing (grows from 80 → 170 words), needs aggressive editing back down.

**Core narrative arc decided:** Administrator → Architect. Built it for myself first, now sharing.

**Key copy elements:**
- "36% of founder time on admin" (Forbes, credible)
- "Task by task, workflow by workflow" (gradual transformation)
- "Operator → Architect" shift
- Trust + Clarity as closing brand bridge

**Research findings (verified):**
- 36% admin time (Forbes/Time etc Survey) — NOT 40% (Founders Forum said 40%, less cited)
- 90% startups fail — YES, but only 2% directly from operations (CB Insights). Don't claim "fail because of operations"
- 500K open positions in Germany (tech/healthcare/trades)
- 95% of VC GPs use Excel for LP reporting (Riskrate, April 2025)
- 75% of VC-backed startups fail (Harvard/Shikhar Ghosh)

**Pattern:** Florian wants to include ALL problems (SME, VC, startups, workers) in one section. Mia's job: split into multiple website sections, keep "Why I built this" personal and short.

## Disk Space Fix
- Deleted cache-trace.jsonl (3.8 GB) → freed to 6.8 GB
- main.sqlite = 13 GB, locked by gateway, needs VACUUM during restart
- main.sqlite breakdown: chunks_vec = 13.1 GB (!), chunks = 357 MB, embedding_cache = 302 MB
