### SOTA Research Applied (~01:00)
- **AgentAuditor → Sub-Agent Quality Gate**: Added reflection pattern to AGENTS.md. Every sub-agent must self-audit before completing. Targets the ~20% error rate.
- **Memory-R1 → Evening Distillation**: Updated Evening Review cron with "Store only what changes future behavior in 30 days" principle.
- **Cron autonomy blocked**: Added rule that crons MUST NOT modify SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md autonomously.
- **AIRS-Bench**: Potential framework for benchmarking our own research agent quality. Not implemented yet.
- **9 Agentic Patterns (Beam.ai)**: We use Router-Specialist + ReAct. Need: Planner-Critic-Executor + Reflection Loop. Don't need: Tree of Thoughts, LATS, ReWOO, Debate.

### Morning Session (~08:00-09:30)

**Reports AR-033 to AR-040 Status:**
- AR-033 to AR-037: ✅ Done (completed overnight)
- AR-038 (Costs): ✅ Done (3rd attempt succeeded, CPUO framework)
- AR-039 (Pipeline): Still running
- AR-040 (Evolution): ✅ Done
- All 8 PDFs generated via browser→PDF and sent to Florian via Telegram

**VC Pipeline Research Done:**
- 50 AI-focused funds researched, output: `research/inbox/vc-pipeline-50-funds-2026-02-17.md`
- Top matches: Glasswing (Agent Autonomy Framework), Radical ($1.8B), Earlybird/HV/La Famiglia (Munich network), Conviction (Sarah Guo), Nyca (NYC, active posting)
- NEW finds: FutureSight Ventures (EIR NYC, active hiring), Seligman Ventures ($500M AI fund launched Feb 12!), Innovate.VC (EIR program)
- 5 cold outreach drafts written, waiting for Florian to send

**Python Research Pipeline Built:**
- `projects/research-pipeline/pipeline.py` — Multi-model routing (Haiku extract → Sonnet synthesize → Opus write)
- ~$1.34 per report, $200 budget = ~149 reports
- anthropic package installed, 3 example reports pre-configured (AR-041 to AR-043)
- Needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var

**Architecture Changes Implemented:**
- `SUB-AGENT-CONTEXT.md` created (1.4KB) — shared context for all sub-agents (decisions, design system, priorities)
- AGENTS.md updated: Typed Memory (MIRIX-inspired), Memory-R1 STORE/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP rules
- Evening Review cron updated with Memory-R1 protocol

**Report Quality Issue Identified:**
- AR-033 to AR-040 have degraded quality vs AR-001/002
- Root cause: Sub-agents = one-shot, no iterative review, no design system access
- Apple emojis crept into HTML, CSS drift, font inconsistencies
- QA sub-agent spawned to fix all reports
- Future fix: `report-template.html` with placeholders, design compliance in quality gate

**Obsidian Cleanup Started:**
- 488 → 383 active files
- Archived: 40_People (duplicate), root orphans, _NAV/_Index boilerplate
- Ordner-für-Ordner review started with Florian (Freie-Presse-KI pending decision)

**Cron Bloat Alert:**
- Back to 21 cron jobs (was consolidated to 8, crept back up to 21)
- Need second consolidation pass

**WhatsApp Gateway:**
- 15+ disconnects today (408 status), auto-reconnects each time
- Monitoring but not actionable yet

**Key Insight from Report Read-Through:**
The 5 architecture changes needed: (1) Typed Memory, (2) Sub-Agent Shared Context, (3) Memory-R1, (4) Context Priority Pinning, (5) CPUO Dashboard. Implemented #2 and #3 today. #1 documented in AGENTS.md. #4 and #5 still TODO.

## "Why I Built This" — Website Copy Session (~10:15-11:45)

**Iteration process:** Florian wrote raw text → Mia refined → Florian expanded → cycle repeated 5+ times. Key tension: Florian keeps adding ideas while writing (grows from 80 → 170 words), needs aggressive editing back down.

**Core narrative arc decided:** Administrator → Architect. Built it for myself first, now sharing.

**Key copy elements:**
- "36% of founder time on admin" (Forbes, credible)
- "Task by task, workflow by workflow" (gradual transformation)
- "Operator → Architect" shift
- Trust + Clarity as closing brand bridge

**Research findings (verified):**
- 36% admin time (Forbes/Time etc Survey) — NOT 40% (Founders Forum said 40%, less cited)
- 90% startups fail — YES, but only 2% directly from operations (CB Insights). Don't claim "fail because of operations"
- 500K open positions in Germany (tech/healthcare/trades)
- 95% of VC GPs use Excel for LP reporting (Riskrate, April 2025)
- 75% of VC-backed startups fail (Harvard/Shikhar Ghosh)

**Pattern:** Florian wants to include ALL problems (SME, VC, startups, workers) in one section. Mia's job: split into multiple website sections, keep "Why I built this" personal and short.

## Disk Space Fix
- Deleted cache-trace.jsonl (3.8 GB) → freed to 6.8 GB
- main.sqlite = 13 GB, locked by gateway, needs VACUUM during restart
- main.sqlite breakdown: chunks_vec = 13.1 GB (!), chunks = 357 MB, embedding_cache = 302 MB

---

## Website Iterations (~10:15-13:00)

**About Section (formerly "Why I built this"):**
- Renamed: "Why I built this" → "About me" → "About"
- Final copy: "Too many of my best working days went to reporting..." → admin always won → built AI for myself → now making it accessible
- Added white text highlights on key phrases (4 highlights: "admin always won", "doing → directing", "days → minutes", "work that matters")
- Added closing line: "The goal isn't to produce more. It's to free you for the work that matters."
- Closing line option C chosen over A ("free you for the work that matters" > "what moves you forward")

**Showcase KPIs redesigned:**
- Replaced NEGATIVE stats (6% trust, 25% correctness, 40% canceled) with POSITIVE ones
- Corporate: "2 days → 30 min board prep" → "40% → 12% time gathering vs. deciding"
- Research: "24 sources" → "73% confidence, every claim scored E/I/J/A"
- Due Diligence: key insight updated to "One signal that changes the investment decision"
- Showcase subtitle: removed "Researched, verified, and synthesized." → just "A working system. See for yourself."

**Report download link:** Changed from PDF to HTML report (research/state-of-agent-trust-2026/index.html)

**Service tags on all 10 reports:** "AI Strategy · System Design · Execution · Consultancy · Research"

**Beipackzettel (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Added to all 6 missing reports with individual confidence scores (58%-78%). Added to SUB-AGENT-CONTEXT.md as mandatory standard.

**Mobile-menu bug:** DE privacy + terms showed mobile nav on desktop. Fixed. Added rule to SUB-AGENT-CONTEXT: every page with nav.js must include mobile-menu CSS.

**Resources page redesigned:** Reordered (Toolkit → Prompts → Findings → Reading → Grants), filter pills in landing-page style (white active, border inactive), Output+Why lines per tool, freshness signal.

## Bürgermeister Demo Prep (~13:30-14:00)

**Dashboard updated with REAL data:**
- 12 verified Förderprogramme (SAB, KfW, EFRE, BMBF, etc.) — 50-90% Zuschuss
- 3 echte Nachrichten: Müglitztalbahn-Unglück, Ortsteile-Demografie (SZ), 784K€ Investitionen
- 5 Sofortmaßnahmen-Box
- Apple emojis → custom letter-badges (N/B/D/€/!)
- Footer: "Florian Ziesche · AI Strategy · System Design · Execution · ainaryventures.com"
- Files: foerdermittel-live.json, foerdermittel-live.md, nachrichten-glashuette.md

**Bürgermeister WhatsApp sent:** Terminvorschläge Mi-Fr ab 15h, Mo-Di 9-14h

**Key research stats verified:**
- 36% founder admin time (Forbes) — NOT 40%
- 90% startups fail but only 2% from operations (CB Insights)
- 500K open positions Germany
- 95% VC GPs use Excel for LP reporting

## Legal Pages
- AGB nicht nötig als Freelancer
- Privacy + Impressum müssen aktualisiert werden (aktuell SaaS-Sprache)
- "[Launch-Datum]" entfernt, "Ainary" → "ich" in Prose

### Workbench / Execution Center (~20:48–21:04)

**Problem identified (Florian's feedback):**
- 3 universal blockers on EVERY task: (1) FINDING elements, (2) UNCERTAINTY about them, (3) QUALITY of elements
- Florian can't find his own files without asking Mia → Mia = bottleneck = bad
- "Execution Center" v1 was wrong: showed "send" button when real blockers are UPSTREAM (prerequisite tasks, missing info)
- 11 cover letters ready, 0 sent. 8 blocked by missing email addresses alone.

**Glasswing strategy decision:** Florian wants LinkedIn + HN post FIRST, then send Glasswing email with social proof. Mia pushed back: parallel not sequential (send today, follow-up tomorrow with links). Florian's reasoning is valid but risk = infinite "I'll send after X" chain.

**Solution built: Kanban Workbench** (`projects/workbench/index.html`)
- 5 stages: IDEA → DRAFT → REVIEW → READY → SENT
- Sidebar with navigation (VC, Content, Consulting, Grants, Decisions, Blockers)
- Trust Scores in sidebar (all agents with bar visualization)
- Board + List view toggle
- Each card: title, blocker (red), next step (gold), expandable details + files
- Progress bar at top showing pipeline distribution

**Folder restructure done:** Each fund in `job-applications/` now has own folder with CV.pdf, CoverLetter.pdf, STATUS.txt. No more hunting.

**Key learning:** Don't jump to output. Ask questions first. Florian said "Feedback-Block mit Fragen, mit deiner Reflexion" — understand the problem before building. Built 2 wrong things (Execution Center v1, then v2) before getting direction right on v3 (Kanban).

**Florian's vision:** ChatGPT-like stages UI where items move up as they progress. Visual progress tracking. A page he opens every morning and works from ALL DAY — not a report, a workbench.

**Design rule (21:05):** NO Apple emojis in tools/dashboards. State-of-the-art design matching website aesthetic: Inter font, #0a0a0a bg, #141414 surfaces, #262626 borders, colored dots instead of emojis. Reference: OpenAI platform UI + florianziesche.com website. Clean, professional, no toy look.

**Workbench v3 (21:05):** Rebuilt with website design system. Kanban with colored dots per stage, Inter font, dark theme matching site. Trust scores in sidebar with bar viz. Board/List toggle. Progress strip. Location: `projects/workbench/index.html`

### Execution Platform — Full Concept (21:05–21:43)

**What it is:** An Execution Platform for Outcome with built-in Preference Learning. NOT a dashboard. A working environment where Human + AI collaborate per topic toward outcomes.

**Architecture (final):**
1. **Flywheel Pipeline as Navigation** — Research → Systems → Content → Revenue. If Revenue is empty, need more Content. If Content empty, need more Research. Pipeline shows gaps.
2. **Topic-based Conversations** — Each item (application, decision, content) has its own chat thread. Mia proposes, Florian decides, they build the path together.
3. **Proposals with Confidence** — Every Mia recommendation shows: confidence % + reasoning. "82% — Standard procedure for tax debt."
4. **Clickable Options** — A/B/C options that expand to show concrete drafts/actions. Click to select → next step activates.
5. **A/B Testing** — Two variants side by side for preference learning. Email formal vs. direct. Post technical vs. personal. Over time Mia learns Florian's style.
6. **Context Panel** — Documents, connected topics, verified knowledge, timeline. All linked and clickable.
7. **Daily Eval** — 10 questions, multi-select (not single choice), pattern analysis at end.
8. **Trust Score on every recommendation** — How sure + why. Upvote/downvote on each.
9. **Vote system** — Upvote = trust rises. Downvote = Mia learns what doesn't work.

**Critical rules:**
- EVERYTHING starts as Draft. No auto-posting, no auto-sending.
- Trust Score > 80 required before ANY discussion of autonomous actions.
- Current trust: 8/100. Long way to go.
- Monochrome design only. No emoji. No rainbow colors. One warm accent (#d4a853) + one danger (#c47070).

**File:** `projects/workbench/index.html` (~36KB)

**Design iterations today:** Execution Center v1 (wrong — showed send button) → Workbench v2 (wrong — Kanban with my stages) → v3 (better — Kanban monochrome) → v4 (right direction — Celonis process mining) → v5 (correct — Human+AI conversation per topic) → v6 (final — Flywheel pipeline + A/B + confidence + expandable options)

**Key insight from Florian:** "Du sagst ready, aber das heißt nicht dass ICH ready bin." Stages must reflect HIS progress, not Mia's assessment. Progress = his checked steps, not Mia's labels.

### Evening Session — Execution Platform + VC Emails (~21:30-23:00)

**Execution Platform Backend gebaut:**
- FastAPI + SQLite backend: `projects/workbench/backend/app.py`
- 20 Topics seeded mit Messages, Proposals, Steps, Connections, Documents
- WebSocket für Live-Updates (Debounced, Scroll-aware)
- File Viewer Endpoint (`/view/path`) für Workspace-Dateien
- References Section im Context Panel (Golden Standard / Zielbild)
- Rule-based Responses (Stufe 1) — Keyword-Matching, nicht echte AI
- Port 8080, Server muss manuell gestartet werden

**8 VC Email Research abgeschlossen:**
- Subagent lieferte Emails für: Betaworks, Bloomberg Beta, Conviction, FirstMark, General Catalyst, Lionheart, Lux, Point72
- 6 High Confidence, 2 Medium (General Catalyst, Point72)
- Alle STATUS.txt updated mit Send-Commands

**Glasswing CV updated:**
- HOF-Design übernommen (Inter, gold accent, clean)
- Content für Glasswing angepasst: AI Trust + Governance Angle
- `job-applications/glasswing/CV_Glasswing_Ziesche.html` + PDF generiert

**Kindergarten München — neues Topic:**
- Kinderhaus Schwabing, Belgradstr. 52, 80796 München
- €450/Monat, Floriana nutzt es nicht
- Kündigungsschreiben als Draft, Adresse eingegeben
- DRINGEND: Jeder Monat = €450 verbrannt

**Neue Regel: Confidence < 70% → fragen. ≥ 70% → kategorisieren + Score zeigen.**

**Kritische Selbstreflexion:**
- 2h Platform gebaut statt 8 Emails zu senden = Building-Pattern
- Platform hat echte Schwächen: Responses sind Keyword-Matching, Actions führen nichts aus
- Morgenplan: SENDEN vor BAUEN

**Morgenplan (Prio-Reihenfolge):**
1. 8:30 — CVs mit HOF-Design für alle 8 Funds generieren
2. 9:00 — Florian reviewed 8 Cover Letters + Subject Lines
3. 9:30 — 8× gog gmail send
4. 10:00 — Kiga-Kündigung ausdrucken + Post
5. 10:30 — ALG1 Antrag nächster Schritt
6. Nachmittag — Platform: echte Actions (gog gmail send via Button)

### Late Night Session — CV Generator v2 + Platform Polish (~23:00-23:55)

**CV Generator v2 — Major improvements based on Florian's review:**
- €5.5M → **€5M** corrected (3.5M equity + 1.5M grants)
- Subtitle: dropped "Investor" → "AI Operator · Founder" (honest, surveyable)
- Footer: neutral "Florian Ziesche · February 2026" for all cold outreach
- Website: florianziesche.com → **ainaryventures.com**
- GitHub link added to header
- Summary: "execution platform" → "designing agent execution workflows" (weicher, ehrlicher)
- "Operator who ships complete solutions" removed (redundant — CV shows it)
- ISO 27001 claim removed → "enterprise compliance documentation, customer onboarding (GDPR, data security)"
- VC Lab added as **own Experience role** (Fund Thesis + Deal Flow bullets)
- Deutschdata merged into Other Experience line
- Education: M.Sc. + B.Sc. merged into 1 block (2012-2019)
- Experience bullets reordered: Fundraising → AI Product → Revenue → Sales → Team

**New fund configs added:**
- **Primary Venture Partners** — OIR: Agents role. "Operator-In-Residence — AI Agents". Bull's eye fit. Apply: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/primary/ba5f3b7e-9698-4d4a-906c-1b85e46ac8bb
- **FutureSight** — Founding CEO, AI GTM Agents for SMBs. JD fetched. Apply: https://apply.workable.com/futuresight/j/84B663F263/
- Primary + FutureSight = studio/incubation models, both want operator-builders

**CV Generator architecture (`projects/workbench/backend/cv_generator.py`):**
- Single source of truth: CONTACT, EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, OTHER_EXP
- Fund-specific: FUND_CONFIG dict with subtitle, summary, proficiencies, footer
- Unknown funds → `_universal` config automatically
- HTML → Chrome headless → PDF
- 7 custom configs: betaworks, bloomberg-beta, lux, ibm-ventures, glasswing, futuresight, primary
- API: POST /api/actions/generate-cv/{fund_id}

**Platform improvements:**
- WebSocket live updates (debounced, scroll-aware)
- File viewer: HTML files render as pages, not code
- References section in context panel (golden standard / target)
- Documents as real `<a>` links, clickable
- All topics now have messages + proposals

**Key decision: Confidence threshold**
- ≥ 70% → categorize, show score
- < 70% → ask Florian

**Key insight: CV trust scoring approach**
- Every section rated with confidence %
- Florian appreciated the transparency, led to better CV
- "Explain your reasoning and confidence" = powerful review pattern

**Warm intro opportunity:**
- Christian Busch (linkedin.com/in/christianbusch, Glass Cube Investments) may know Primary partners
- Need to verify: does Florian know Christian? What's the actual connection?
- Jason Shuman = Primary partner

**Next: FutureSight CV review, Primary application, then batch send remaining VCs**
