## External Sends
- [ ] None yet (CRITICAL - need sends today!)

## Built
- [x] [01:15] Built: Build Blocker System (capability-evolver mutation)

## System Evolution
- [x] [01:15] Evolution Cycle #0021: Created automatic build enforcement
  - `scripts/pre-build-check.sh` - Blocks builds if send ratio too low
  - `scripts/log-send.sh` - Easy logging of external sends
  - `agents/BUILD-BLOCKER.md` - Full documentation
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` with enforcement rules
  - **Problem solved**: €2,105 opportunity cost from building without sending

## Revenue
- €0 (pending)

## Notes
- CNC Planner v18 work continued from previous session (quote section)
- Build blocker mutation deployed to prevent repeat of 5-day zero-send pattern
- System now REQUIRES sends before allowing excessive building

---

**Next Priority**: SEND something before building anything else!

Candidates:
- CNC outreach emails (9 ready in `products/cnc-planner/leads/READY-TO-SEND-EMAILS.md`)
- VC applications (5 ready in `job-applications/READY-TO-APPLY.md`)
- Substack article #2 (ready for publish)
