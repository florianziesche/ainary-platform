- Files: README.md, cover-letter.md, linkedin-post.md, twitter-reply.md, physical-note.md, intro-request.md, decile-message.md, etched-benchmark.md
- Strategy: Portal + VC Lab network + Christian Busch intro + Twitter @BSchech + LinkedIn post + Physical mail + Etched benchmark

**CV Generator System Updates:**
- experience_override per fund config (custom Experience blocks)
- Global fixes: €5M (not 5.5M), Ainary Ventures links, GitHub link, neutral footers for cold outreach
- Fund-specific subtitles: Portal apps get company name, cold outreach = neutral
- 36ZERO company line: only name linked, no description (consistent)
- All em-dashes/arrows removed from content (LLM language cleanup)
- IR → "IR" abbreviation in Proficiencies
- Footer bug fixed (name was doubled)

**Key Design Decision:**
- Primary brand = monochromatic black/white → CV adapted: no gold, no blue links
- Header border = black (dominant), summary accent = grey (subordinate) → visual hierarchy
- Links = black underlined (not blue)

**GitHub:**
- Account: github.com/florianziesche (was fziescheus-alt, needs username change)
- Added GitHub link to ainaryventures.com website (EN + DE)

**Ollama + LM Studio:**
- brew install started, may not have completed (sessions killed)
- Plan: install tomorrow, run benchmarks, update CV to v2 "MORGEN" config

**Honest CV Assessment:**
- Overall: 78%. Strong but not BOOM yet.
- Weakness: Ainary bullets have NO outcomes/numbers (only features)
- Weakness: "Used 12h+ daily" = input metric, not output
- Weakness: "Agent Systems Builder" is a made-up title
- Strength: Trust-as-a-currency is unique, no competitor has it
- Strength: 36ZERO section is bulletproof (real numbers)
- Strength: Fund Thesis has conviction

**Florian's Working Style Observations:**
- "Dont just correct and execute, think and question and get the whole image"
- "Quality >>> iterations and quick fixes"
- Pushes back hard on LLM language, wants authenticity
- Prefers honest confidence scores over optimistic assessments
- Values "hyperthink" — deep analysis before action

### Primary CV v2 — Final Refinements (Session 2)

**3 Critical Fixes Applied:**
1. Title: "Agent Systems Builder & AI Consultant" → "Founder Operator & Consultant (AI Systems)" (real title, not made-up)
2. OS bullet: "Used 12h+ daily" → "Daily output: automated research, document generation, multi-channel operations" (output > input)
3. VC Lab: "Building proprietary sourcing pipeline..." → "Sourcing and evaluating early-stage AI startups. Due diligence, deal memos." (honest, not inflated)

**New Consulting Bullet Added to Ainary:**
- "Founder-operator advisory for German-US startups. Helped raise $700K, supported YC admission. AI systems strategy and go-to-market."
- Now 4 bullets: Consulting, OS, Trust & Evals, Execution

**Education Updated:**
- B.Sc. Focus: Finance & Engineering. M.Sc. Focus: Finance & IT (Data Science).
- Thesis font: 8.5pt #555 (was 8pt #777 — too small/light)

**Design — Primary Brand Matching:**
- Summary accent line: gold → black → **grey #999** (final). Reason: two black lines (header + accent) competed. Grey creates hierarchy.
- Links: blue → black underlined (matches primary.vc)
- Footer: stronger black line (1.5px #1a1a1a)
- Prof grid label column: 80px → 95px

**Florian's Consulting Work (NEW FACT):**
- Advisory for German-US startups
- Helped client raise $700K
- Supported client's YC Combinator admission
- This was MISSING from all previous CVs

**Ainary Website Assessment:**
- ainaryventures.com is strong: "Multiply your team", research reports, trust metrics, interactive demo
- Brian will be impressed when he clicks the link
- Design: dark mode, gold accents, professional

**CV "Used 12h+ daily" Lesson:**
- Florian explicitly said this was bad — input metric not output
- Always frame work in terms of what it PRODUCES, not time spent
