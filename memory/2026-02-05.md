## Night Session (04:00-05:10)

### LinkedIn Post — Deep Philosophy Session
- Worked 1+ hour on LinkedIn repost for VC Lab Task 8
- Started with Sequoia "This is AGI" vs Yann LeCun debate
- Evolved into Florian's unique angle: **AI can't perceive time**
- Key insight from Florian: "Memory requires the experience of time. A machine has no perception of duration — just states."
- Connected to Karl Friston's Active Inference (VERSES AI) — "Consciousness is inference about the future"
- Final direction: AI without stakes isn't intelligence, it's pattern matching

**Near-final post (~650 chars):**
```
Sequoia says AGI is here.

Yann LeCun — who invented neural networks and just left Meta with €500M to prove them wrong — says we're nowhere close.

One of them is fundamentally wrong.

Here's the gap nobody talks about: every AI agent operates on snapshots. Read. Reason. Act. Forget. Repeat. No continuity. No persistent world model.

Your brain updates its understanding of reality 40 times per second. The best AI does it once per prompt.

LeCun left Meta to fix this. He's building world models — systems that perceive continuously, not in batches. Not bigger language models. A different architecture entirely.

Sequoia's benchmarks show agents doubling in capability every 7 months. But they're measuring speed within the wrong paradigm.

The next breakthrough won't come from scale. It'll come from architecture. That's the bet that matters.

You don't get from a horse to a car by breeding faster horses.

### SOTA Research Brief Created
- `research/sota-2026-02-05.md` — comprehensive weekly AI research tracking
- Key stories: Sequoia AGI essay, OpenAI retiring 6 models, Apple×Google Siri, Amazon 16K displacement, Meta $135B capex, Project Genie, AlphaGenome, Xcode agentic coding
- Synced to Obsidian: `20-Knowledge/AI-Research/2026-02-05-SOTA.md`

## Morning Session (10:35-11:00)

### CNC Demo Progress
- Initial meeting at Onkel's company successful
- **Full demo scheduled: 14:00 today with Andreas (Arbeitsvorbereiter)**
- Prepared Customer Discovery questions (Mom Test style)

### VC Lab Sprint 2
- Florian working on Step 7 (Decile Hub setup) — watching 50 min video
- Step 8 (LinkedIn Post) — prepared two options:
  1. Time perception post (deep, philosophical)
  2. Dario Amodei job disruption post (trending, accessible)

### Dario Amodei Post (Alternative — More Viral)
- Amodei's 20,000-word essay: "unusually painful" job disruption
- 50% entry-level white-collar jobs gone in 5 years
- MIT: AI can already replace 11.7% of US workforce
- Post ready in chat (~700 chars)

### VC Applications — Target: 3 by 14:00
- 5 applications READY in `job-applications/READY-TO-APPLY.md`:
  1. HOF Capital — VC Analyst (AI/SWE required) ⭐⭐⭐ PERFECT FIT
  2. Betaworks — Investment Associate (Agent Systems focus)
  3. Leonis Capital — Associate (research-driven)
  4. Point72 Ventures — AI Ventures Associate
  5. Conviction — Speculative outreach
- Goal: Send at least 3 today

## Key Research Findings

### Who's Working on AI Time Perception:
| Company | Person | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| VERSES AI | Karl Friston (Chief Scientist) | Active Inference — "consciousness is inference about the future" |
| AMI Labs | Yann LeCun | World models, persistent memory, JEPA architecture |
| World Labs | Fei-Fei Li ($5B) | Spatial intelligence, Large World Models |
| DeepMind | — | Genie 3, real-time interactive worlds |

### Memory/Forgetting Research:
- Nature 2025: "Biological synapses balance retention and flexibility; AI struggles with catastrophic forgetting"
- Preprints.org: "Temporal Blindness Problem" — AI cannot represent lived temporal experience

## Today's Priorities (Rest of Day)

1. ✅ Initial CNC meeting — DONE, demo at 14:00
2. ⬜ Submit 3 VC applications (HOF, Betaworks, Leonis)
3. ⬜ VC Lab Step 7 (Decile Hub) — in progress
4. ⬜ VC Lab Step 8 (LinkedIn Post) — draft ready
5. ⬜ 14:00 CNC Demo with Andreas
6. ⬜ 3 CNC outreach emails after demo
7. ⬜ Substack #2 publish

## Lessons Learned

- **Florian's philosophy insight**: "Can we really call it memory if there's no experience of time? It's just snapshots. A machine has no perception of duration — just states."
- **Time perception = the real AGI frontier**: Not scale, not architecture alone — giving machines the experience of time passing
- **LinkedIn 2026 best practices**: Punchy hook above fold, contrarian angle, ~700-1000 chars, no hashtags

## 🧬 Evolution Cycle #0019 (14:28 CET)

**Mutation Applied:** Created `scripts/launch-outreach.sh`

**Problem Identified:**
- EXECUTION-TRACKER shows 0 CNC outreach, 0 VC applications sent this week
- 9 CNC emails + 5 VC applications are READY but not sent
- `track-send.sh` exists but is passive (logs after fact)

**Solution:**
- New proactive launcher script that:
  - Shows what's ready to send
  - Opens files directly for action
  - Includes interactive mode
  - Reminds: "Prep without send = 0 value"

**Usage:** `./scripts/launch-outreach.sh [vc|cnc|all]`

**Lesson:** Tooling should PUSH action, not just RECORD action.
