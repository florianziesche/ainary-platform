## Session Context (00:45-01:00 CET)

### Landing Showcase Simplification — DONE
- Reduced from multiple cases per tab to 1 each: Manufacturing (Tab 1), Arclight AI (Tab 2), Prompting (Tab 3 unchanged)
- Removed switchCase() + switchDD() JS functions, -311 lines
- Committed to git

### Tools Page Restructure — PLANNED (not built yet)
- Florian approved direction: "plane und überlege gut bevor du beginnst"
- Plan: Remove showcase tabs (duplicate of landing), add Use Cases grid (moved from landing), 3 product deep-dives (AI Readiness / Due Diligence / AI Research), Research Engine as infra section, trimmed FAQ
- Key insight: Landing = convince, Tools = inform (depth, not repetition)

### Daily Brief Evolution — Florian's Ideas (msg 3912)
- **"So What"** nach jedem Signal — actionable takeaway
- **Volle Artikel** — Signals als Teaser → Blog full analysis (Funnel: Brief → Blog → Tool)
- **Predictions mit Tracking** — wöchentliche Predictions loggen, Accuracy tracken, "Prediction Scorecard"
- Florian begeistert von Predictions als Differentiator
- Format: SIGNAL → SO WHAT → PREDICTION (Confidence + Timeframe)
- Mein Vote: Alle drei, Predictions = unique moat
- Status: Approved conceptually, not yet built

## Session Context (01:00-01:30 CET)

### Tools Page v2 → Use Cases Page — DONE
- **5 value-focused use cases** with Before/After + KPIs from CNC-VC-Problems.md research:
  1. CNC Quoting (45min→4min, €890K recovered, 92% time saved)
  2. LP Reporting (2 weeks→minutes, 35% better LP retention)
  3. Competitive Intelligence (3 weeks €30K→5 min)
  4. Startup Due Diligence (2 weeks→5 min first pass, 10x more deals)
  5. Market Entry Research (6 weeks→5 min decision brief)
- Products as compact 3-card grid (AI Readiness / DD / AI Research)
- "How I build every report" section integrated (was on quality.html)
- 5 FAQs, CTA with analyze input
- Old tools-v1 already archived

### "Use Cases" Naming Unified — DONE
- Renamed "Products" → "Use Cases" across ALL 14 HTML pages (nav links)
- Hyperlink stays tools.html (no file rename needed)
- Committed to git

### Blog + Pricing Review — PLANNED (Florian said "hyperthink")
**Blog issues identified:**
- "From the team" → solo founder voice
- "X-Ray" references → update to current product names
- "Join 0 professionals" → remove until real number
- Footer outdated (old product names, dead Careers link)
- Quick fixes, no rebuild needed

**Pricing issues identified:**
- 4 tiers → 3 (Free / Pro / Custom) — less choice paralysis
- Nav dots inconsistency
- Old product names (Corporate X-Ray, Startup X-Ray)
- Credits grid needs update (3 products not 5)
- Feature comparison table outdated
- Mixed USD/EUR — should be USD throughout
- "3 free credits" vs landing "1 free report" — needs alignment
- Moderate overhaul, not rebuild

**Status:** Blog fixes DONE. Pricing rebuild planned for morning.

### Blog Fixes — DONE (01:25 CET)
- Solo voice ("team" → "I") in subtitle + meta
- "Research deeper with X-Ray" → "Run a free report on any company" (→ signup.html) on all 3 articles
- Article #3 retitled: "How I Built an AI Intelligence Platform in 48 Hours" + updated product names
- "Join 0 professionals" → "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime."
- Footer updated on blog + pricing: AI Readiness / Due Diligence / AI Research / Daily Brief, Careers removed, "How I Build" added
- Pricing nav dots removed (was inconsistent with other pages)

### Pricing Rebuild — PLANNED for morning
Florian approved the plan:
- **3 Tiers** (Free / Pro / Custom) — drop Business tier
- **1 Credit = 1 Report** — simplify from 5 different credit costs
- **"1 free report" messaging** — align with landing page
- **USD throughout** — international target
- **Feature table: 5-6 rows max** — not 20
- **Updated product names** — AI Readiness, Due Diligence, AI Research

### Key Decision: Pricing Simplification
- 4→3 tiers (Florian approved "ok")
- Credits simplified: all reports = 1 credit
- Free = 1 report, Pro = 15 reports/mo ($29), Custom = unlimited ($5,000+)
- Rationale: Less choice paralysis, clearer value prop, Linear/Vercel/Cursor all do 3 tiers
