# 2026-02-15 — Memory Log

## Report Template Design System Session (00:00-00:18)

### Completed
- **Design Tokens & Component Library (00-design-tokens.html)** — 22 components fully spec'd with exact CSS (fonts, sizes, weights, colors, spacing). Every element programmed like a standard component.
- **Template Chooser upgraded:**
  - 16 QA answer fields added (auto-save localStorage)
  - 50 per-option comment fields added (Florian's request: "maybe I like one thing in a different Option still more")
  - Cover Options D + E added (BCG role-based + McKinsey no-audience-tag)
  - Selection persistence (localStorage)
  - Design Tokens linked in sidebar
- **Quote Page Options (02-quote-page-options.html)** — 3 options built, awaiting Florian's choice

### Key Decisions
- **D-147: Template Chooser = potential product** — Florian: "Genial!! Sollten wir pflegen und vlt als Product mitliefern"
- **D-148: Cover Audience** — "Audience ist besser als die Rolle" → Audience definition in Exec Summary, NOT on cover. Cover stays clean.
- **D-149: Research-based approach** — Florian: "Research ist die ground truth for me." All design decisions must cite benchmarks (BCG, McKinsey, Economist).
- **D-150: Chooser workflow = standard for everything** — "We should always work like this, same for website, other tools, dashboards plus an option to write comments"
- **Cover: Option E (Mia's vote)** — No audience tag, title = audience filter, confidence top-right. Florian hasn't formally picked yet.

### Citation Format (5 proposals given)
- Mia's vote: #3 — "Ziesche, F. (2026). [Title]. Ainary Research Report, AR-XXX. Produced via multi-agent research pipeline: automated source synthesis, cross-validation, and confidence calibration. Human-directed, AI-executed."
- Awaiting Florian's choice

### Methodology Placement
- Mia's vote: Short version after Exec Summary, long version in Appendix (McKinsey pattern)
- Awaiting Florian's choice

### Still Open from Template Chooser
- Quote Page choice (A/B/C)
- All 16 elements need Florian's formal pick
- Template LOCK before any new reports

### Template Refinement (00:46-01:47)
- **REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html BUILT** (63KB) — all 16 picks, Security Playbook content, production-ready
- **"Security Theater" → "Checkbox security"** — Florian didn't know the term, replaced with clearer alternative
- **Back Cover CTA: "Contact · Feedback"** (not "Start a project →") — diskret, neutral, kein Sales-Signal im Research-Kontext
- **Cite as: Shortened** — just `Ziesche, F. (2026). [Title]. Ainary Research, AR-XXX.` One line, no "AI-assisted" (already in Transparency Note)
- **Author Bio discussion** — "informed by experience building AI products across US and Europe" not completely true. 5 alternatives proposed. Mia's vote: #4 ("builds AI-augmented research systems at Ainary Ventures. Before that, CEO of 36ZERO Vision"). Awaiting Florian's pick.
- **Methodology Position HYBRID** — Short paragraph Ch.2, full details in Appendix (McKinsey pattern)
- **D-151: Back Cover CTA = "Contact · Feedback"** — not "Start a project →". Sales undermines research credibility.

### TEMPLATE LOCKED (01:58 CET)
- **TEMPLATE-RULES.md** — 8KB, all 16 elements + hard rules + process rules
- **REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html** — 63KB, production-ready
- **Citation: Ainary Research (not Ziesche, F.)** — System = author, Florian = director
- **Back Cover: "Contact · Feedback"** — not "Start a project →"
- **Author Bio FINAL:** "...where AI does 80%...HUMAN × AI = LEVERAGE. This report is the proof."
- **TOC: CONTENTS black, FOUNDATION/ANALYSIS/ACTION grey**
- **"Checkbox security" not "Security Theater"**
- Florian: "Du kannst alles in stein schreiben. Fix. Passt so."

### Reports Pipeline (02:12-02:21)
- **AR-010 (Agent Failure Taxonomy) ✅ COMPLETE** — 72% confidence, 26 pages, 15 claims, 6 failure modes, HTML+PDF
- **AR-011 (HITL Illusion) ✅ COMPLETE** — 75% confidence, 15 claims, Boeing/Uber cases, HITL routing matrix
- **AR-012 (Trust Moat) ✅ COMPLETE** — 75% confidence, 12 claims, Klarna case, 5 moat types
- **AR-013 (Developer Trust Gap) ✅ COMPLETE** — 72% confidence, developer UX problem not values problem
- **AR-014 (Agent Memory & Context) ← RUNNING** — spawned 02:46, last report in series
- Florian: "Lass es durchlaufen. Lass dir Zeit. Hyperthink. Nichts überstürzen."
- All use locked TEMPLATE-RULES.md + REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html
- PDF via html-to-pdf.sh ($0)

### CV-Chooser (02:16-running)
- Florian wants Chooser Pattern for CV too — "dann kommen wir schnell zum ziel"
- 12 elements, 3 options each, same UI as Report Chooser
- Universal CV base, swappable per application
- Key feedback on v3: subtitle too specific, summary too generic, Ainary block vague, needs report portfolio link
- CV-CHOOSER.html building parallel to reports

### CV v4 Chooser Decisions (02:41)
- Florian completed all 12 elements in CV-CHOOSER
- Key picks: Header A (remove Green Card, add website/substack/linkedin), Subtitle A, Summary B (Unfair Advantage + AI systems USP), Ainary B (Research-focused + link), 36ZERO A, Earlier Roles A, VC Lab B (but shorter — 2 bullets max), Education B (condensed), Skills B (VC-first), Footer A, Design A, Strategy A (universal + subtitle swap)
- Florian's key insight: AI systems = USP for portfolio startups AND the VC that hires him
- Florian wants link to research reports in CV
- VC Lab proportional to time invested (3mo vs 6yr 36ZERO)
- Mia agreed all 3 points with reasoning

### Meta-Learnings Agent spawned (02:50)
- Analyzing AR-001-013 for actionable learnings for our own system
- Mirror Test: where does Mia/OpenClaw fail per our own research?
- Hypotheses to test + implement

### Downloads Cleanup Assessment (02:50)

- Awaiting Florian's go-ahead
- Last Google Drive upload: Feb 14 23:03 CET (52 files)

### ALL 14 REPORTS COMPLETE (02:57)
- AR-014 (Agent Memory) ✅ — 82% confidence, MINJA attack >95% success, 0/5 frameworks have provenance
- **Full series AR-001 through AR-014 DONE**
- QA range: 79-92/100, Avg ~86

### GitHub Repo PUBLIC (02:58)

- Research Hub: `/content/website/research.html` — 14 report cards with links
- Both opened for Florian's review

### AR-006 Shared on GitHub (02:55)
- Best report = AR-006 Security Playbook (QA 92/100)
- Pushed to `content/reports/public/` on GitHub (ainary-platform repo)
- Repo is PRIVATE — Florian needs to make public or deploy to website
- Florian wants to share with a friend

### Meta-Learnings Complete (02:55)
- `content/reports/META-LEARNINGS.md` — 8 failures in our own system per our own research
- 7 hypotheses, 3 implement-today items
- Accountability: H1+H2 by Feb 22 or it's evidence of research-practice gap

### CV v4 + Research Hub Page (02:53)
- Both building in parallel (spawned 02:53)
- CV v4 with all Chooser picks + website/linkedin/substack links
- /research/ hub page with all 14 reports

### Agent Trust Ledger + Dashboard (03:32)
- Florian approved building the full system
- Hash-chain (local, not real blockchain) with SHA-256
- 4 tabs: Pipeline, Economics, Trust Chain, Intelligence Health
- Claim Registry tracking cross-report facts

- Decision immutability via hash chain
- Sub-agent spawned on Sonnet

### AR-015 Knowledge Compounding COMPLETE (03:47)
- First report using OUR OWN DATA as evidence
- Key finding: Quality NOT compounding (QA flat ~85.6), Efficiency IS compounding (Memory 20%→96%, Tokens -50%)
- Proposes KCI v2 framework: Emergence Rate + Self-Reference Ratio + Value per Note
- 0 existing quantitative frameworks for knowledge compounding found in literature
- Opus agent, HTML+PDF delivered
- **15 TOTAL REPORTS NOW (AR-001→AR-015)**

### Vault Compound Experiment COMPLETE (04:13)
- 5 architectures tested: Flat, PARA, Zettelkasten, MOC-Hybrid, Graph-First
- 50 identical notes per vault, 10 test questions, 5 metrics = 250 data points
- **Winner: Graph-First (92.1)** but margin over Zettelkasten (83.4) is small
- **KEY FINDING: 0→3 links = +33 quality points. 3→5 links = only +5. Diminishing returns.**
- **PARA ≤ Flat — folders don't help compounding AT ALL**
- Recommendation: MOC-Hybrid + min 3 links + frontmatter. Expected +50% inference, +40% emergence
- All files in `/experiments/vault-compound-test/` — EXPERIMENT.md, 5 vaults, RESULTS.md, dashboard-data.json, RESULTS-DASHBOARD.html
- Content angle: "I Tested 5 Knowledge Architectures. Folders Don't Matter. Links Do."

### 5 Compound Research Briefs COMPLETE (04:08)
- 01-retrieval-science: Retrieval method may matter more than storage architecture
- 02-graph-theory: Optimal link density ~4-6/note (mean), power-law distribution
- 03-cognitive-load: Atomic notes better for AI, possibly worse for humans (split-attention)
- 04-information-retrieval: Search makes architecture irrelevant for directed retrieval, but NOT for serendipitous discovery
- 05-transactive-memory: Vault is primarily Mia's memory; MOC-Hybrid best for dual-interface
- Cross-insight: MOC-Hybrid predicted winner theoretically, confirmed empirically

### AR-015 Knowledge Compounding COMPLETE (03:47)
- Opus agent, first report using OWN DATA as evidence
- Quality NOT compounding (QA flat ~85.6), Efficiency IS (Memory 20%→96%)

- 30_People/ vs 40_People/ KEPT BOTH (public figures vs personal network)
- Remaining: 96 orphan notes for next round (target 95+)

### Dashboard Live-Update Gap (04:22)
- Florian asked how dashboard stays live
- Honest answer: it doesn't — static snapshot currently
- Solution: Post-run rule in SOUL.md "No agent result without Ledger update"
- TODO: Implement as discipline rule, not code

### Git Committed (04:24)
- All night work pushed to ainary-platform main

- All on Sonnet, no web search needed

### AR-001-010 Redesign SPAWNED (04:32)
- Two agents: AR-001-005 + AR-006-010
- Design update only, preserve all content
- Apply locked template to all existing reports

### Brave Search Key Updated (04:58)
- New key: BSAdtmtj31Yas8pHEBK5qYaCkzK-EYo (config patched + restart)
- First key was Free Plan (exhausted). Second attempt WORKS — search confirmed functional

- Running: AR-003-005, AR-006, AR-010, AR-018
- Pre-redesign HTMLs archived: `archive/2026-02/reports-pre-redesign/` (24 files)
- Git committed

### Website Chooser — Need Chrome Access (04:59)
- Florian filled out WEBSITE-CHOOSER.html in Chrome
- Picks are in Chrome localStorage — can't read from OpenClaw browser (isolated)
- Asked Florian to run `copy(JSON.stringify(localStorage))` in Chrome Console
- Still waiting for picks

### Florian: "Vergiss das Versionieren nicht" (04:59)
- Archived all pre-redesign reports before overwriting
- Archiv-Regel reinforced: NICHTS löschen, always archive/YYYY-MM/

### CORRECTION: Send-First Too Dogmatic (04:34)
- Florian: "Manchmal ist bauen leverage für den outreach"
- Florian: Weekly goals > daily goals
- Tonight's building IS the ammunition for Monday's launch
- **New rule: WEEKLY targets, not daily enforcement**
- KW8 goals: 3 reports published, 10 outreach, 1 lead, 3 external feedbacks

### AR-018 Observability Gap COMPLETE (05:04)
- 72% confidence, 72KB HTML, built entirely from AR-009 + AR-010 (no web search)
- 10 claims, 5 predictions, 4-layer observability stack proposed
- **18 TOTAL REPORTS NOW (AR-001 → AR-018)**

### Website Chooser Picks EXTRACTED + VERSIONED (05:00)
- Florian sent PDF export of filled chooser
- All 18 picks extracted and saved to `WEBSITE-PICKS-v1.md`
- 5 changes needed: Geist font, scroll reveals, nav text, stats bar, SEO engine
- 13 elements stay as-is
- Git committed

### Florian's Session Summary Request (05:03)
- "Was haben wir gelernt und ob wir uns nachweislich verbessert haben"
- Key learnings: Template-First works, Links>Folders quantified, own data = strongest, QA doesn't auto-compound, weekly > daily targets, sub-agents don't improve (system does)
- Proven improvements: Reports 9→18, Memory 20%→96%, Tokens -50%, Vault 77→89
- NOT improved: QA score (flat 85.6), Distribution (0), Revenue (€0), External validation (0)

### Capability Evolver Findings (05:03)
- Send enforcement failed: 5 days zero outreach, €2,105 opportunity cost
- Implemented: send-enforcer.sh in heartbeat, git pre-commit hook, send-tracker.md
- OpenClaw v2026.2.14: Telegram polls, cron delivery, image workspace paths
- ClawHub security: 341 malicious skills found — use only verified/own skills
- AI workflow patterns validate AR-007, AR-008, AR-011

### Backlog: Memory Quality (05:09)
- Florian: "Das setzen wir morgen oder Montag um"
- Problem: Memory Accuracy 96% = finding rate. But are the RIGHT things stored?
- Next bottleneck: Storage quality, not retrieval quality
- TODO: Audit what's stored vs what's useful

### MONDAY PLAN (Feb 16)
- Distribution Day — NOT building day
- Publish Substack article "Folders Don't Matter. Links Do."
- Push reports to website /research/
- LinkedIn posts from research
- AgentTrust launch (cron set for 13:45 CET)
- Outreach with reports as proof points
- Florian agreed: "Ich stimme zu"

### Vault Optimization RUNNING (04:17)
- Backup to Google Drive ✅ (20MB, id: 1yZE7Tl7tUL76PEClaE1UBN0EUH610z9R)
- Vault-optimize sub-agent spawned (Sonnet) — adding frontmatter + 3 links/note + orphan fix
- Vault-Rules.md written to 99_System/ with Freshness + Link + Archive + Cite=Verify rules
- Approach: OPTIMIZE not rebuild (links are the most valuable asset, rebuild would destroy them)

### Freshness System DESIGNED (04:20)
- `last_verified` frontmatter field on every note
- Cite = Verify rule: when Mia cites a note, she checks + updates last_verified
- Weekly staleness scan: Top 5 stale notes surfaced
- >30 days unverified = flagged

### Killer Article COMPLETE (04:21)
- `content/articles/knowledge-architecture-test.md`
- "I Tested 5 Knowledge Architectures With 250 Data Points. Folders Don't Matter. Links Do."
- ~2400 words, PARA takedown, AI agent angle, honest limitations
- Ready for Substack

### Session Email SENT (04:18)
- Full summary to florian@ainaryventures.com (msg 19c5f510a1ab8ed1)
- All deliverables, findings, open items documented

### Paper Idea (04:17)
- Vault experiment = potential academic paper
- Venues: CHI, CSCW, arXiv
- Prof. Friedl (TUM) as feedback partner
- Need: larger N, human participants, longitudinal data

### Research vs Revenue Discussion (04:20)
- Florian: "Research hat den größten Wert"
- Mia pushed back: 15 reports × $0 = hobby. Distribution needed.
- Monday = Launch day. Send first.

### Honesty Meta-Discussion (03:36)
- Florian pushed 3x for deeper thinking on compound measurement
- Mia acknowledged can't distinguish trained honesty from genuine epistemic humility
- IR Theory could invalidate entire experiment premise — disclosed this upfront
- "The outcome is the same: better decisions"

### Agent Trust Dashboard COMPLETE (03:41)
- `/agents/AGENT-DASHBOARD.html` — 4 tabs (Pipeline, Economics, Trust Chain, Intelligence Health)
- `/agents/TRUST-LEDGER.json` — Real SHA-256 hash chain, 14 entries, 15 claims, 10 decisions, 7 hypotheses
- "Verify Chain Integrity" button actually works
- All real data, no placeholders

### Brave Search Quota EXHAUSTED (03:36)
- 2000/2000 monthly limit hit
- Affects all agents doing web research
- Brave Pro is configured but free plan quota ran out

### Knowledge Compounding Research Discussion (03:33-03:40)
- Florian pushed 3x for deeper thinking ("Bist du dir sicher?")
- Key insight: Nobody has quantitatively measured knowledge compounding. Luhmann, Forte, Matuschak = anecdotal
- Research gap = our opportunity
- 3 real proxies: Emergence Rate, Self-Reference Ratio, Value per Note
- Transactive Memory (Wegner 1987) applies to Human+AI dyad
- Archiv-Regel: NICHTS löschen, alles in archive/YYYY-MM/

### Website-Chooser COMPLETE (03:23)
- `/projects/platform-website/WEBSITE-CHOOSER.html`
- 18 elements, 3 options each, ElevenLabs/Linear/Vercel benchmarks
- Agency Brief at top, opened for Florian

### Second Brain Research COMPLETE (03:22)
- `/content/reports/second-brain-research-2026.md`
- Vault score 7-8/10 structure, under-utilized
- Key rec: Periodic Notes + Weekly Review + Dataview/Templater
- No new system needed, just use what exists

### Website Research Section COMPLETE (03:13)
- research.html rebuilt in blog design
- 3 individual report reading pages (AR-006, AR-008, AR-009)
- Florian wants research on website with proper design

### Token Optimization DONE (03:13)
- All workspace context files slimmed: 18.5k → 9.1k tokens/turn (-50%)
- BOOTSTRAP.md deleted, TOOLS.md stripped to configured only, AGENTS.md/SOUL.md/USER.md/HEARTBEAT.md compressed
- No content lost — details moved to memory/ topic files (on-demand)

### Website Chooser (03:09)
- Opus agent running WEBSITE-CHOOSER.html — 18 elements, 3-5 options each

- AR-006 + AR-011 uploaded
- ainary-platform repo back to PRIVATE

### API Cost Estimate
- Today's total: ~$60-70 in pure API costs
- 13 reports + CV Chooser + Template Chooser + research + website + misc
- Sonnet for Builder/QA = ~40% savings vs all-Opus

### Nancy
- 00:13 — Nancy messaged wanting to talk, Florian notified via Telegram
- 00:21 — "Call her back in a minute" relayed via iMessage
