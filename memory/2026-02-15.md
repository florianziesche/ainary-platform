## Report Template Design System Session (00:00-00:18)

### Completed
- **Design Tokens & Component Library (00-design-tokens.html)** — 22 components fully spec'd with exact CSS (fonts, sizes, weights, colors, spacing). Every element programmed like a standard component.
- **Template Chooser upgraded:**
  - 16 QA answer fields added (auto-save localStorage)
  - 50 per-option comment fields added (Florian's request: "maybe I like one thing in a different Option still more")
  - Cover Options D + E added (BCG role-based + McKinsey no-audience-tag)
  - Selection persistence (localStorage)
  - Design Tokens linked in sidebar
- **Quote Page Options (02-quote-page-options.html)** — 3 options built, awaiting Florian's choice

### Key Decisions
- **D-147: Template Chooser = potential product** — Florian: "Genial!! Sollten wir pflegen und vlt als Product mitliefern"
- **D-148: Cover Audience** — "Audience ist besser als die Rolle" → Audience definition in Exec Summary, NOT on cover. Cover stays clean.
- **D-149: Research-based approach** — Florian: "Research ist die ground truth for me." All design decisions must cite benchmarks (BCG, McKinsey, Economist).
- **D-150: Chooser workflow = standard for everything** — "We should always work like this, same for website, other tools, dashboards plus an option to write comments"
- **Cover: Option E (Mia's vote)** — No audience tag, title = audience filter, confidence top-right. Florian hasn't formally picked yet.

### Citation Format (5 proposals given)
- Mia's vote: #3 — "Ziesche, F. (2026). [Title]. Ainary Research Report, AR-XXX. Produced via multi-agent research pipeline: automated source synthesis, cross-validation, and confidence calibration. Human-directed, AI-executed."
- Awaiting Florian's choice

### Methodology Placement
- Mia's vote: Short version after Exec Summary, long version in Appendix (McKinsey pattern)
- Awaiting Florian's choice

### Still Open from Template Chooser
- Quote Page choice (A/B/C)
- All 16 elements need Florian's formal pick
- Template LOCK before any new reports

### Template Refinement (00:46-01:47)
- **REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html BUILT** (63KB) — all 16 picks, Security Playbook content, production-ready
- **"Security Theater" → "Checkbox security"** — Florian didn't know the term, replaced with clearer alternative
- **Back Cover CTA: "Contact · Feedback"** (not "Start a project →") — diskret, neutral, kein Sales-Signal im Research-Kontext
- **Cite as: Shortened** — just `Ziesche, F. (2026). [Title]. Ainary Research, AR-XXX.` One line, no "AI-assisted" (already in Transparency Note)
- **Author Bio discussion** — "informed by experience building AI products across US and Europe" not completely true. 5 alternatives proposed. Mia's vote: #4 ("builds AI-augmented research systems at Ainary Ventures. Before that, CEO of 36ZERO Vision"). Awaiting Florian's pick.
- **Methodology Position HYBRID** — Short paragraph Ch.2, full details in Appendix (McKinsey pattern)
- **D-151: Back Cover CTA = "Contact · Feedback"** — not "Start a project →". Sales undermines research credibility.

### TEMPLATE LOCKED (01:58 CET)
- **TEMPLATE-RULES.md** — 8KB, all 16 elements + hard rules + process rules
- **REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html** — 63KB, production-ready
- **Citation: Ainary Research (not Ziesche, F.)** — System = author, Florian = director
- **Back Cover: "Contact · Feedback"** — not "Start a project →"
- **Author Bio FINAL:** "...where AI does 80%...HUMAN × AI = LEVERAGE. This report is the proof."
- **TOC: CONTENTS black, FOUNDATION/ANALYSIS/ACTION grey**
- **"Checkbox security" not "Security Theater"**
- Florian: "Du kannst alles in stein schreiben. Fix. Passt so."
