# 2026-02-15 — Memory Log

## Pipeline v2.2 + AR-001-v2 Session (12:15-13:15)

### ChatGPT → OpenClaw Merge COMPLETE
- Read ALL 26 files from `Vault/60_Resources/Prompts/` including canonical system prompts:
  - `06_SYSTEM_PROMPT__Exec_Research_v2.txt` (in `~/FZ/Projects/Code/exec-research-factory/`)
  - `07_REVIEWER_PROMPT__Exec_Research_v1.txt` (same dir)
  - `06_AB_SYSTEM_PROMPT__Asset_Builder_v1.txt` (in `~/FZ/Projects/Code/asset-builder/`)
- Merged into Pipeline v2.2: `agents/A-PLUS-PIPELINE-v2.md` (9 phases)
- Created 7 canonical spawn templates in `agents/spawn-templates/`
- Created governance: PROMPT-REGISTRY.md, CHANGELOG.md, EVAL-PACK.md (10 regression tests), SYSTEMS.md (8 systems)
- Pipeline visual: `agents/PIPELINE-VISUAL.html`

### Key Learnings from Merge
1. FRESHNESS is a SOURCE FILTER not a label — sources outside window cannot be sole evidence
2. Claim Ledger BEFORE writing (not after) — fundamentally better
3. E/I/J/A classification on every claim — Evidence/Interpretation/Judgment/Assumption
4. "No new uncited claims in Repair" — Fix agents were adding unverified claims
5. 16-point rubric (8×2) replaces free-form scores
6. Asset Builder as Phase 9 — 30 reports produced 0 reusable assets
7. Retrieval-optimized writing: explicit nouns, standalone bullets, "This answers: ..."
8. QA must audit BEFORE editing, output in fixed order, suggest source TYPES not fabricated sources

### 10 Learnings from 30 Reports (documented)
1. Every report with calculations had wrong math
2. Confidence clusters suspiciously at 62-82%
3. Best reports had OWN data
4. Cross-refs create citation cartel (self-citation as evidence)
5. Fix agents introduce unverified new claims
6. QA scores don't compound (AR-029 proof: 84.8→87.6→83.4)
7. Adversarial review = highest ROI step
8. "Simulation" vs "Experiment" — agents systematically exaggerate
9. Reports correcting other reports are most valuable
10. 0 external feedback — biggest gap

### AR-026-030 A+ Reports — ALL QA'd + Fixed
| Report | QA Score | Key Fix |
|--------|----------|---------|
| AR-026 Knowledge Architecture | 68→~82 | 8/8 Exhibit values wrong, "+45%" → "+54%" |
| AR-027 Real Cost | 81→~88 | $45-85 → $70-80, ROI 9-53x → 10-18x |
| AR-028 Governance Reality | 78→~85 | NIST 50% → 45%, Combined 60% → 55% |
| AR-029 Quality Compound | 85→~90 | Sinha cherry-pick fixed, "Blind Test" renamed |
| AR-030 Multi-Model | 80→~85 | SWE-bench 77.2% → 64.8% |

### AR-001-v2 — First v2.2 Pipeline Run (IN PROGRESS)
- Phase 0-1: Control Panel + Research Brief ✅
- Phase 2: Research Agent → 16 sources (100% within 12mo), 20 claims, 3 contradictions ✅
- Phase 4: Validation → 6 YES, 4 PARTIAL, 0 FALSE, 7 corrections required ✅
- Phase 5: Writer → 61KB HTML + PDF, all corrections applied ✅
- Phase 6: QA → Running
- Phases 7-9: Pending

### Decisions
- Fund-Research prompt: NOT needed for pipeline
- Extract-Conversation-Learnings: NOT needed for pipeline
- Python orchestrator: YES but AFTER first manual v2 run (Dienstag/Mittwoch)
- Claude Project: NO — downgrade from OpenClaw capabilities
- Dashboard updated (COCKPIT.html) — was 8 days stale

### Files Created/Updated
- `agents/A-PLUS-PIPELINE-v2.md` (v2.0→v2.2)
- `agents/spawn-templates/` (7 files)

## Report Template Design System Session (00:00-00:18)

### Completed
- **Design Tokens & Component Library (00-design-tokens.html)** — 22 components fully spec'd with exact CSS (fonts, sizes, weights, colors, spacing). Every element programmed like a standard component.
- **Template Chooser upgraded:**
  - 16 QA answer fields added (auto-save localStorage)
  - 50 per-option comment fields added (Florian's request: "maybe I like one thing in a different Option still more")
  - Cover Options D + E added (BCG role-based + McKinsey no-audience-tag)
  - Selection persistence (localStorage)
  - Design Tokens linked in sidebar
- **Quote Page Options (02-quote-page-options.html)** — 3 options built, awaiting Florian's choice

### Key Decisions
- **D-147: Template Chooser = potential product** — Florian: "Genial!! Sollten wir pflegen und vlt als Product mitliefern"
- **D-148: Cover Audience** — "Audience ist besser als die Rolle" → Audience definition in Exec Summary, NOT on cover. Cover stays clean.
- **D-149: Research-based approach** — Florian: "Research ist die ground truth for me." All design decisions must cite benchmarks (BCG, McKinsey, Economist).
- **D-150: Chooser workflow = standard for everything** — "We should always work like this, same for website, other tools, dashboards plus an option to write comments"
- **Cover: Option E (Mia's vote)** — No audience tag, title = audience filter, confidence top-right. Florian hasn't formally picked yet.

### Citation Format (5 proposals given)
- Mia's vote: #3 — "Ziesche, F. (2026). [Title]. Ainary Research Report, AR-XXX. Produced via multi-agent research pipeline: automated source synthesis, cross-validation, and confidence calibration. Human-directed, AI-executed."
- Awaiting Florian's choice

### Methodology Placement
- Mia's vote: Short version after Exec Summary, long version in Appendix (McKinsey pattern)
- Awaiting Florian's choice

### Still Open from Template Chooser
- Quote Page choice (A/B/C)
- All 16 elements need Florian's formal pick
- Template LOCK before any new reports

### Template Refinement (00:46-01:47)
- **REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html BUILT** (63KB) — all 16 picks, Security Playbook content, production-ready
- **"Security Theater" → "Checkbox security"** — Florian didn't know the term, replaced with clearer alternative
- **Back Cover CTA: "Contact · Feedback"** (not "Start a project →") — diskret, neutral, kein Sales-Signal im Research-Kontext
- **Cite as: Shortened** — just `Ziesche, F. (2026). [Title]. Ainary Research, AR-XXX.` One line, no "AI-assisted" (already in Transparency Note)
- **Author Bio discussion** — "informed by experience building AI products across US and Europe" not completely true. 5 alternatives proposed. Mia's vote: #4 ("builds AI-augmented research systems at Ainary Ventures. Before that, CEO of 36ZERO Vision"). Awaiting Florian's pick.
- **Methodology Position HYBRID** — Short paragraph Ch.2, full details in Appendix (McKinsey pattern)
- **D-151: Back Cover CTA = "Contact · Feedback"** — not "Start a project →". Sales undermines research credibility.

### TEMPLATE LOCKED (01:58 CET)
- **TEMPLATE-RULES.md** — 8KB, all 16 elements + hard rules + process rules
- **REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html** — 63KB, production-ready
- **Citation: Ainary Research (not Ziesche, F.)** — System = author, Florian = director
- **Back Cover: "Contact · Feedback"** — not "Start a project →"
- **Author Bio FINAL:** "...where AI does 80%...HUMAN × AI = LEVERAGE. This report is the proof."
- **TOC: CONTENTS black, FOUNDATION/ANALYSIS/ACTION grey**
- **"Checkbox security" not "Security Theater"**
- Florian: "Du kannst alles in stein schreiben. Fix. Passt so."

### Reports Pipeline (02:12-02:21)
- **AR-010 (Agent Failure Taxonomy) ✅ COMPLETE** — 72% confidence, 26 pages, 15 claims, 6 failure modes, HTML+PDF
- **AR-011 (HITL Illusion) ✅ COMPLETE** — 75% confidence, 15 claims, Boeing/Uber cases, HITL routing matrix
- **AR-012 (Trust Moat) ✅ COMPLETE** — 75% confidence, 12 claims, Klarna case, 5 moat types
- **AR-013 (Developer Trust Gap) ✅ COMPLETE** — 72% confidence, developer UX problem not values problem
- **AR-014 (Agent Memory & Context) ← RUNNING** — spawned 02:46, last report in series
- Florian: "Lass es durchlaufen. Lass dir Zeit. Hyperthink. Nichts überstürzen."
- All use locked TEMPLATE-RULES.md + REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html
- PDF via html-to-pdf.sh ($0)

### CV-Chooser (02:16-running)
- Florian wants Chooser Pattern for CV too — "dann kommen wir schnell zum ziel"
- 12 elements, 3 options each, same UI as Report Chooser
- Universal CV base, swappable per application
- Key feedback on v3: subtitle too specific, summary too generic, Ainary block vague, needs report portfolio link
- CV-CHOOSER.html building parallel to reports

### CV v4 Chooser Decisions (02:41)
- Florian completed all 12 elements in CV-CHOOSER
- Key picks: Header A (remove Green Card, add website/substack/linkedin), Subtitle A, Summary B (Unfair Advantage + AI systems USP), Ainary B (Research-focused + link), 36ZERO A, Earlier Roles A, VC Lab B (but shorter — 2 bullets max), Education B (condensed), Skills B (VC-first), Footer A, Design A, Strategy A (universal + subtitle swap)
- Florian's key insight: AI systems = USP for portfolio startups AND the VC that hires him
- Florian wants link to research reports in CV
- VC Lab proportional to time invested (3mo vs 6yr 36ZERO)
- Mia agreed all 3 points with reasoning

### Meta-Learnings Agent spawned (02:50)
- Analyzing AR-001-013 for actionable learnings for our own system
- Mirror Test: where does Mia/OpenClaw fail per our own research?
- Hypotheses to test + implement

### Downloads Cleanup Assessment (02:50)

- Research Hub: `/content/website/research.html` — 14 report cards with links
- Both opened for Florian's review

### AR-006 Shared on GitHub (02:55)
- Best report = AR-006 Security Playbook (QA 92/100)
- Pushed to `content/reports/public/` on GitHub (ainary-platform repo)
- Repo is PRIVATE — Florian needs to make public or deploy to website
- Florian wants to share with a friend

### Meta-Learnings Complete (02:55)
- `content/reports/META-LEARNINGS.md` — 8 failures in our own system per our own research
- 7 hypotheses, 3 implement-today items
- Accountability: H1+H2 by Feb 22 or it's evidence of research-practice gap

### CV v4 + Research Hub Page (02:53)
- Both building in parallel (spawned 02:53)
- CV v4 with all Chooser picks + website/linkedin/substack links
- /research/ hub page with all 14 reports

### Agent Trust Ledger + Dashboard (03:32)

- Hash-chain (local, not real blockchain) with SHA-256
- 4 tabs: Pipeline, Economics, Trust Chain, Intelligence Health
- Claim Registry tracking cross-report facts
- Agent Reputation scoring over time
- Decision immutability via hash chain
- Sub-agent spawned on Sonnet

### AR-015 Knowledge Compounding COMPLETE (03:47)
- First report using OUR OWN DATA as evidence
- Key finding: Quality NOT compounding (QA flat ~85.6), Efficiency IS compounding (Memory 20%→96%, Tokens -50%)
- Proposes KCI v2 framework: Emergence Rate + Self-Reference Ratio + Value per Note
- 0 existing quantitative frameworks for knowledge compounding found in literature
- Opus agent, HTML+PDF delivered
- **15 TOTAL REPORTS NOW (AR-001→AR-015)**

### Vault Compound Experiment COMPLETE (04:13)
- 5 architectures tested: Flat, PARA, Zettelkasten, MOC-Hybrid, Graph-First
- 50 identical notes per vault, 10 test questions, 5 metrics = 250 data points
- **Winner: Graph-First (92.1)** but margin over Zettelkasten (83.4) is small
- **KEY FINDING: 0→3 links = +33 quality points. 3→5 links = only +5. Diminishing returns.**
- **PARA ≤ Flat — folders don't help compounding AT ALL**
- Recommendation: MOC-Hybrid + min 3 links + frontmatter. Expected +50% inference, +40% emergence
- All files in `/experiments/vault-compound-test/` — EXPERIMENT.md, 5 vaults, RESULTS.md, dashboard-data.json, RESULTS-DASHBOARD.html
- Content angle: "I Tested 5 Knowledge Architectures. Folders Don't Matter. Links Do."

### 5 Compound Research Briefs COMPLETE (04:08)
- 01-retrieval-science: Retrieval method may matter more than storage architecture
- 02-graph-theory: Optimal link density ~4-6/note (mean), power-law distribution
- 03-cognitive-load: Atomic notes better for AI, possibly worse for humans (split-attention)
- 04-information-retrieval: Search makes architecture irrelevant for directed retrieval, but NOT for serendipitous discovery
- 05-transactive-memory: Vault is primarily Mia's memory; MOC-Hybrid best for dual-interface
- Cross-insight: MOC-Hybrid predicted winner theoretically, confirmed empirically

### AR-015 Knowledge Compounding COMPLETE (03:47)
- Opus agent, first report using OWN DATA as evidence
- Quality NOT compounding (QA flat ~85.6), Efficiency IS (Memory 20%→96%)

- 11 MOC index files created
- 119 files modified, 0 deleted
- 30_People/ vs 40_People/ KEPT BOTH (public figures vs personal network)
- Remaining: 96 orphan notes for next round (target 95+)

### Dashboard Live-Update Gap (04:22)
- Florian asked how dashboard stays live
- Honest answer: it doesn't — static snapshot currently
- Solution: Post-run rule in SOUL.md "No agent result without Ledger update"
- TODO: Implement as discipline rule, not code

### Git Committed (04:24)
- All night work pushed to ainary-platform main
- Includes: AR-010-015, CV v4, Trust Dashboard, Vault Experiment (5 vaults + 250 data), Website Chooser, token optimization, vault optimization

### Claim Notes in Obsidian (04:28)

- All on Sonnet, no web search needed

### AR-001-010 Redesign SPAWNED (04:32)
- Two agents: AR-001-005 + AR-006-010
- Design update only, preserve all content
- Apply locked template to all existing reports

### Brave Search Key Updated (04:58)
- New key: BSAdtmtj31Yas8pHEBK5qYaCkzK-EYo (config patched + restart)
- First key was Free Plan (exhausted). Second attempt WORKS — search confirmed functional

- **Rule: No reports without Search = No B-Ware**

### AR-016 + AR-017 COMPLETE (04:55)
- AR-016: Agent Economics (own data as evidence)
- AR-017: Build vs Buy vs Compose
- AR-018: Spawned separately (agent hit token limit)

- Running: AR-003-005, AR-006, AR-010, AR-018
- Pre-redesign HTMLs archived: `archive/2026-02/reports-pre-redesign/` (24 files)
- Git committed

### Website Chooser — Need Chrome Access (04:59)
- Florian filled out WEBSITE-CHOOSER.html in Chrome
- Picks are in Chrome localStorage — can't read from OpenClaw browser (isolated)
- Asked Florian to run `copy(JSON.stringify(localStorage))` in Chrome Console
- Still waiting for picks

### Florian: "Vergiss das Versionieren nicht" (04:59)
- Archived all pre-redesign reports before overwriting
- Archiv-Regel reinforced: NICHTS löschen, always archive/YYYY-MM/

### CORRECTION: Send-First Too Dogmatic (04:34)
- Florian: "Manchmal ist bauen leverage für den outreach"
- Florian: Weekly goals > daily goals
- Tonight's building IS the ammunition for Monday's launch
- **New rule: WEEKLY targets, not daily enforcement**
- KW8 goals: 3 reports published, 10 outreach, 1 lead, 3 external feedbacks

### AR-018 Observability Gap COMPLETE (05:04)
- 72% confidence, 72KB HTML, built entirely from AR-009 + AR-010 (no web search)

### Website Chooser Picks EXTRACTED + VERSIONED (05:00)
- Florian sent PDF export of filled chooser
- All 18 picks extracted and saved to `WEBSITE-PICKS-v1.md`
- 5 changes needed: Geist font, scroll reveals, nav text, stats bar, SEO engine
- 13 elements stay as-is
- Git committed

### Florian's Session Summary Request (05:03)
- "Was haben wir gelernt und ob wir uns nachweislich verbessert haben"
- Key learnings: Template-First works, Links>Folders quantified, own data = strongest, QA doesn't auto-compound, weekly > daily targets, sub-agents don't improve (system does)
- Proven improvements: Reports 9→18, Memory 20%→96%, Tokens -50%, Vault 77→89
- NOT improved: QA score (flat 85.6), Distribution (0), Revenue (€0), External validation (0)

### Capability Evolver Findings (05:03)
- Send enforcement failed: 5 days zero outreach, €2,105 opportunity cost
- Implemented: send-enforcer.sh in heartbeat, git pre-commit hook, send-tracker.md
- OpenClaw v2026.2.14: Telegram polls, cron delivery, image workspace paths
- ClawHub security: 341 malicious skills found — use only verified/own skills
- AI workflow patterns validate AR-007, AR-008, AR-011

### All 18 Redesigns COMPLETE (05:20)
- AR-004 + AR-005 were last — finished 05:20
- All 18 reports now in unified locked template
- Git committed: "All 18 reports redesigned"
- TODO: Stichprobe 3 random reports (promised)

### Florian's 12 High-ROI Topics Request (08:59)
- Asked for top 12 from 50-topic roadmap
- Recommended: Healthcare, Legal, Manufacturing, Insurance, Change Mgmt (leads), Memory Map, Trust Scores, Agent Economics (VC), Governance Theater, Agent Testing (content), Trust Transfer, Knowledge Flywheel (compound)
- Monday recommendation: Healthcare + Agent Economics + Governance Theater (3 different audiences)

### AR-019-025 ALL COMPLETE (09:20)
- Florian selected 7 topics (his picks #6-12 from my list) at 09:01
- All 7 produced in ~20 min (4 parallel agents on Sonnet with Search)
- AR-019: Agent Memory Market Map (82%) — Mem0 $24M, 4-layer market
- AR-020: Trust = Credit Scores (68%) — bold contrarian, FICO parallel
- AR-021: Agent Economics Enterprise (82%) — 3-7x hidden cost multiplier
- AR-022: Governance Theater (76%) — 72-point gap, named ISO/NIST/EU
- AR-023: Agent Testing Broken (82%) — eval-driven development emerging
- AR-024: Trust Transfer Problem (75%) — PKI parallels, no framework has delegation
- AR-025: Knowledge Compounding Flywheel (72%) — KCI framework, OUR data
- **25 TOTAL REPORTS (AR-001→025)**
- Git committed

### Backlog: Memory Quality (05:09)
- Florian: "Das setzen wir morgen oder Montag um"
- Problem: Memory Accuracy 96% = finding rate. But are the RIGHT things stored?
- Next bottleneck: Storage quality, not retrieval quality
- TODO: Audit what's stored vs what's useful

### MONDAY PLAN (Feb 16)
- Distribution Day — NOT building day
- Publish Substack article "Folders Don't Matter. Links Do."
- Push reports to website /research/
- LinkedIn posts from research
- AgentTrust launch (cron set for 13:45 CET)
- Outreach with reports as proof points
- Florian agreed: "Ich stimme zu"

### Vault Optimization RUNNING (04:17)
- Backup to Google Drive ✅ (20MB, id: 1yZE7Tl7tUL76PEClaE1UBN0EUH610z9R)
- Vault-optimize sub-agent spawned (Sonnet) — adding frontmatter + 3 links/note + orphan fix
- Vault-Rules.md written to 99_System/ with Freshness + Link + Archive + Cite=Verify rules
- Approach: OPTIMIZE not rebuild (links are the most valuable asset, rebuild would destroy them)

### Freshness System DESIGNED (04:20)
- `last_verified` frontmatter field on every note
- Cite = Verify rule: when Mia cites a note, she checks + updates last_verified
- Weekly staleness scan: Top 5 stale notes surfaced
- >30 days unverified = flagged

### Killer Article COMPLETE (04:21)
- `content/articles/knowledge-architecture-test.md`
- "I Tested 5 Knowledge Architectures With 250 Data Points. Folders Don't Matter. Links Do."
- ~2400 words, PARA takedown, AI agent angle, honest limitations
- Ready for Substack

### Session Email SENT (04:18)
- Full summary to florian@ainaryventures.com (msg 19c5f510a1ab8ed1)
- All deliverables, findings, open items documented

### Paper Idea (04:17)
- Vault experiment = potential academic paper
- Venues: CHI, CSCW, arXiv
- Prof. Friedl (TUM) as feedback partner
- Need: larger N, human participants, longitudinal data

### Research vs Revenue Discussion (04:20)
- Florian: "Research hat den größten Wert"
- Mia pushed back: 15 reports × $0 = hobby. Distribution needed.
- Monday = Launch day. Send first.

### Honesty Meta-Discussion (03:36)
- Florian pushed 3x for deeper thinking on compound measurement
- Mia acknowledged can't distinguish trained honesty from genuine epistemic humility
- IR Theory could invalidate entire experiment premise — disclosed this upfront
- "The outcome is the same: better decisions"

### Agent Trust Dashboard COMPLETE (03:41)
- `/agents/AGENT-DASHBOARD.html` — 4 tabs (Pipeline, Economics, Trust Chain, Intelligence Health)
- `/agents/TRUST-LEDGER.json` — Real SHA-256 hash chain, 14 entries, 15 claims, 10 decisions, 7 hypotheses
- "Verify Chain Integrity" button actually works
- All real data, no placeholders

### Brave Search Quota EXHAUSTED (03:36)
- 2000/2000 monthly limit hit
- Affects all agents doing web research
- Brave Pro is configured but free plan quota ran out

### Knowledge Compounding Research Discussion (03:33-03:40)
- Florian pushed 3x for deeper thinking ("Bist du dir sicher?")
- Key insight: Nobody has quantitatively measured knowledge compounding. Luhmann, Forte, Matuschak = anecdotal
- Research gap = our opportunity
- 3 real proxies: Emergence Rate, Self-Reference Ratio, Value per Note
- Transactive Memory (Wegner 1987) applies to Human+AI dyad
- Archiv-Regel: NICHTS löschen, alles in archive/YYYY-MM/

### Website-Chooser COMPLETE (03:23)
- `/projects/platform-website/WEBSITE-CHOOSER.html`
- 18 elements, 3 options each, ElevenLabs/Linear/Vercel benchmarks
- Agency Brief at top, opened for Florian

### Second Brain Research COMPLETE (03:22)
- `/content/reports/second-brain-research-2026.md`
- Vault score 7-8/10 structure, under-utilized
- Key rec: Periodic Notes + Weekly Review + Dataview/Templater
- No new system needed, just use what exists

### Website Research Section COMPLETE (03:13)
- research.html rebuilt in blog design
- 3 individual report reading pages (AR-006, AR-008, AR-009)
- Florian wants research on website with proper design

### Token Optimization DONE (03:13)
- All workspace context files slimmed: 18.5k → 9.1k tokens/turn (-50%)
- BOOTSTRAP.md deleted, TOOLS.md stripped to configured only, AGENTS.md/SOUL.md/USER.md/HEARTBEAT.md compressed
- No content lost — details moved to memory/ topic files (on-demand)

### Website Chooser (03:09)
- Opus agent running WEBSITE-CHOOSER.html — 18 elements, 3-5 options each
- Deep research: ElevenLabs, Linear, Vercel analyzed

### API Cost Estimate
- Today's total: ~$60-70 in pure API costs
- 13 reports + CV Chooser + Template Chooser + research + website + misc
- Sonnet for Builder/QA = ~40% savings vs all-Opus

### Nancy
- 00:13 — Nancy messaged wanting to talk, Florian notified via Telegram
- 00:21 — "Call her back in a minute" relayed via iMessage
- Family iMessage rules followed

### API Status (Florian asked)

- Anthropic: 27% weekly limit remaining
- No unpaid/overdrawn APIs

### AR-001-v2 Pipeline COMPLETE (13:25)
- **Fix Agent:** 6/6 fixes applied, 0 new claims (Cardinal Rule preserved)
  - Camunda added as S17/[16] to Source Log + References (was BLOCKER)
  - €15M "minimum" → "maximum high-risk" penalty (was internal contradiction)
  - Prediction 3: $500M → $450M (reconciled with $419M source data)
  - C8 badge: [E] → [E]* with single-source footnote
  - C6 added to §4 body (was orphaned claim)
  - Uncited McKinsey ref removed + renumbered
- **Final Status:** QA 15/16 PASS, PDF regenerated
- **Pipeline Timing:** ~25 min total (Research 4m, Validation 2.5m, Writer 6m, QA 2m, Fix 4m + gaps)
- **Known issue:** QA announce message replayed 5x due to queuing — not a real problem but noisy
- **Key validation:** v2.2 pipeline WORKS in practice. First manual run successful. Ready for Tuesday Tier 2 topic.

### Pipeline v2.3 "Originality Engine" (13:47-14:20)

#### v1 vs v2 Comparison — Key Finding
- **v1 = Point of View mit schwacher Methodik** (Originalität 9/10, Quellen 4/10)
- **v2 = Starke Methodik ohne Point of View** (Originalität 3/10, Quellen 9/10)
- v1 had: Three-Layer Trust Stack, Overconfidence Pandemic, HITL Spiral, "$0.005 vs €3B+", bold predictions
- v2 had: none of that. Pure survey with excellent source discipline.
- Root cause: no phase asked "What's our original contribution?" + Research Agent searched for consensus not gaps

#### 10 Changes Implemented
1. **NEW Phase 2.5: Thesis Development Agent** — Original Thesis, Framework, Constructed Scenario, Narrative Arc, "Nobody Else Is Saying"
2. **Research Agent: Gap Map + Source Diversity** — 1/3 industry + 1/3 academic + 1/3 practitioner + anti-monoculture check
3. **Writer: Thesis-driven** — Thesis doc as #2 input, Section Title Rule (arguments not categories), Key Insight must be original
4. **QA: 10 dimensions /20 scale** — Added #9 Intellectual Contribution, #10 Narrative & Boldness. Thresholds: T2≥16, T3≥18
5. **Validation: Originality Check** — "Would an expert learn something new?"
6. **Experiment types expanded** — thought_experiment, constructed_scenario. "none" requires justification.
7. **REMOVED: Adversarial Self-Review section** — Florian: "komisches Gefühl, wie McKinsey." Replaced by inline caveats + Transparency Note limitations (5-7 bullets) + Conflict of Interest
8. **Author Bio UPDATED** — OLD: "where AI does 80%... HUMAN × AI = LEVERAGE. This report is the proof." NEW: "Florian Ziesche is the founder of Ainary Ventures and former CEO of 36ZERO Vision, where he raised €5.5M+ and delivered AI solutions for BMW, Siemens, and Bosch. He advises enterprises on AI strategy, governance, and agent infrastructure."
9. **Control Panel: ORIGINAL_THESIS + NARRATIVE_ARC** fields (required Tier 2+)
10. **All 8 templates: Phase 0 PLAN** — think before doing

#### Key Decisions
- **D-161: Adversarial Self-Review REMOVED** — theatrical role-play format undermines credibility. Inline caveats + factual limitations are stronger.
- **D-162: Author Bio = factual, no slogans** — let the work speak. No "this report is the proof."
- **D-163: Section titles must be ARGUMENTS not categories** — "The $52B Market Building on Sand" not "Market Reality"
- **D-164: Reports need original thesis or they're surveys** — QA dimension #9 enforces this (0/2 = FAIL for Tier 2+)
- **D-165: Prediction boldness threshold** — "Would >30% of experts disagree?" If not → observation, not prediction.

### AR-001-v2.3 Pipeline Run Complete (14:50-15:20)

**Erster v2.3 "Originality Engine" Report** — State of AI Agent Trust 2026, dritte Version.

#### Pipeline Timing
Research 3.5min → Thesis 2.5min → Writer 7min → QA 4min → Fix 2.5min → PDF <1min = ~20min total

#### Ergebnisse
- **Thesis:** "Trust Race Model" — AI capability verdoppelt sich alle 7 Monate, Governance updatet jährlich. Gap wird GRÖSSER.
- **Framework:** Trust Race Model (4 Komponenten: Capability Velocity, Reliability Floor, Governance Tempo, Deployment Pressure)
- **Scenario:** Governance Lag Cascade (6 Steps, alle sourced, honest labeled)
- **QA Score:** 18/20 Conditional GO → 2 Blocker + 4 Should-Fix → alle gefixt
- **Sources:** 25 total (8 Industry, 3 Academic, 3 Contrarian, 9 Trade, 1 Standard + 1 Vectra added in Fix)
- **Scoring vs v1/v2:** Originalität 8 (v1:9, v2:3), Methodik 9 (v1:4, v2:9), Total 82 (v1:57, v2:66)

#### Template-Entscheidungen (LOCKED)
- **D-166: System Disclosure RAUS** — redundant mit Methodology (Full) + "About This Report". 3x dasselbe ist zu viel.
- **D-167: Conflict of Interest final wording:** "The publisher of this report researches, builds, and advises on AI agent systems — and has a commercial interest in the conclusions presented here. Evaluate evidence independently; claims marked [J] reflect judgment, not evidence." Nicht bold. Identisch für alle Reports.
- **D-168: "About This Report" bleibt auf letzter Seite** — Florian mag es dort.
- **D-169: CoI keine Service-Liste** — "researches, builds, and advises" deckt alles ab ohne konkrete Services zu nennen.

- Bringt aktuell nichts — statisch, veraltet, kein Nutzer
- Parken bis pipeline.py (Mittwoch). Dann als Live-Frontend reviven.

### AR-031 + AR-032 Pipeline Runs (15:30-15:55)

**Two new v2.3 reports produced in parallel:**

#### AR-031: Personal AI Stack Architecture 2026
- Research: 20 sources, 16 claims, "Personal AI as OS" framing
- Thesis: "Personal AI is an OS you compile, not a product you download." Gateway = Kernel (not LLM). "Memory lock-in will replace vendor lock-in."
- Framework: Personal AI Kernel Model (gateway=kernel, LLM=CPU, memory=virtual memory, channels=I/O, cron=scheduler)
- Scenario: Memory Inheritance Problem (memory becomes lock-in → corrupted memories compound → migration impossible)
- QA: 18/20, 3 conditions (fake Alan Kay quote, unsourced 15% hallucination, missing MCPTox ref) → all fixed
- PDF sent

#### AR-032: Knowledge Compounding with AI: Obsidian + Agent
- Research: 18 sources (perfect 6/6/6 industry/academic/practitioner split)
- Thesis: "Zettelkasten accidentally built ideal RAG architecture 30 years early." YAML frontmatter invisible to AI = biggest PKM time waste.
- Framework: PKM Compounding Flywheel (3 compound: question articulation, index quality, feedback loops | 3 decay: manual links, folders, YAML | 3 inert: note count, plugin choice)
- Scenario: Architect vs Collector vault divergence over 2 years
- QA: 18/20, 1 blocker (Sascha Fast citation wrong source number) + 3 should-fixes → all fixed
- Confidence: 62% (honest — central thesis untested)
- PDF sent

### Template Standardization Decisions (15:48-15:58)

- **D-170: Claim Register Table = Option B (Fixed Widths)** — `table-layout: fixed`, Claim 45%, Type 8%, Source 17%, Confidence 10%, Used In 15%. Header "Classification" → "Type". CLAIM-TABLE-CHOOSER.html created with 5 options.
- **D-171: TOC padding tightened** — `padding: 8px 0` (was 12px). Academic-tight spacing.
- **D-172: "How to Read" section STANDARDIZED** — Identical structure across ALL reports:
  1. Intro paragraph
  2. Table 1: Badge / Meaning / Example (TEXT labels `[E] Evidenced`, not colored spans)
  3. Table 2: Confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)
  4. Overall Confidence Score paragraph (3 factors + framework name)
  5. Pipeline mention + Transparency Note link
  - Only examples, confidence %, and framework name change per report
- **D-173: Confidence Score needs real formula** — Current scores are vibes. Proposed formula: Evidence Ratio × 0.5 + Source Score × 0.35 + 15% base + Originality Adj. NOT YET FINALIZED — Florian to decide.
- **D-174: Methodology should explain 6-phase pipeline** — Research → Thesis → Writing → QA → Repair → Human Review. Currently too vague.
