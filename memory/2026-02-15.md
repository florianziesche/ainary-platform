## Report Template Design System Session (00:00-00:18)

### Completed
- **Design Tokens & Component Library (00-design-tokens.html)** — 22 components fully spec'd with exact CSS (fonts, sizes, weights, colors, spacing). Every element programmed like a standard component.
- **Template Chooser upgraded:**
  - 16 QA answer fields added (auto-save localStorage)
  - 50 per-option comment fields added (Florian's request: "maybe I like one thing in a different Option still more")
  - Cover Options D + E added (BCG role-based + McKinsey no-audience-tag)
  - Selection persistence (localStorage)
  - Design Tokens linked in sidebar
- **Quote Page Options (02-quote-page-options.html)** — 3 options built, awaiting Florian's choice

### Key Decisions
- **D-147: Template Chooser = potential product** — Florian: "Genial!! Sollten wir pflegen und vlt als Product mitliefern"
- **D-148: Cover Audience** — "Audience ist besser als die Rolle" → Audience definition in Exec Summary, NOT on cover. Cover stays clean.
- **D-149: Research-based approach** — Florian: "Research ist die ground truth for me." All design decisions must cite benchmarks (BCG, McKinsey, Economist).
- **D-150: Chooser workflow = standard for everything** — "We should always work like this, same for website, other tools, dashboards plus an option to write comments"
- **Cover: Option E (Mia's vote)** — No audience tag, title = audience filter, confidence top-right. Florian hasn't formally picked yet.

### Citation Format (5 proposals given)
- Mia's vote: #3 — "Ziesche, F. (2026). [Title]. Ainary Research Report, AR-XXX. Produced via multi-agent research pipeline: automated source synthesis, cross-validation, and confidence calibration. Human-directed, AI-executed."
- Awaiting Florian's choice

### Methodology Placement
- Mia's vote: Short version after Exec Summary, long version in Appendix (McKinsey pattern)
- Awaiting Florian's choice

### Still Open from Template Chooser
- Quote Page choice (A/B/C)
- All 16 elements need Florian's formal pick
- Template LOCK before any new reports

### Template Refinement (00:46-01:47)
- **REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html BUILT** (63KB) — all 16 picks, Security Playbook content, production-ready
- **"Security Theater" → "Checkbox security"** — Florian didn't know the term, replaced with clearer alternative
- **Back Cover CTA: "Contact · Feedback"** (not "Start a project →") — diskret, neutral, kein Sales-Signal im Research-Kontext
- **Cite as: Shortened** — just `Ziesche, F. (2026). [Title]. Ainary Research, AR-XXX.` One line, no "AI-assisted" (already in Transparency Note)
- **Author Bio discussion** — "informed by experience building AI products across US and Europe" not completely true. 5 alternatives proposed. Mia's vote: #4 ("builds AI-augmented research systems at Ainary Ventures. Before that, CEO of 36ZERO Vision"). Awaiting Florian's pick.
- **Methodology Position HYBRID** — Short paragraph Ch.2, full details in Appendix (McKinsey pattern)
- **D-151: Back Cover CTA = "Contact · Feedback"** — not "Start a project →". Sales undermines research credibility.

### TEMPLATE LOCKED (01:58 CET)
- **TEMPLATE-RULES.md** — 8KB, all 16 elements + hard rules + process rules
- **REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html** — 63KB, production-ready
- **Citation: Ainary Research (not Ziesche, F.)** — System = author, Florian = director
- **Back Cover: "Contact · Feedback"** — not "Start a project →"
- **Author Bio FINAL:** "...where AI does 80%...HUMAN × AI = LEVERAGE. This report is the proof."
- **TOC: CONTENTS black, FOUNDATION/ANALYSIS/ACTION grey**
- **"Checkbox security" not "Security Theater"**
- Florian: "Du kannst alles in stein schreiben. Fix. Passt so."

### Reports Pipeline (02:12-02:21)
- **AR-010 (Agent Failure Taxonomy) ✅ COMPLETE** — 72% confidence, 26 pages, 15 claims, 6 failure modes, HTML+PDF
- **AR-011 (HITL Illusion) ✅ COMPLETE** — 75% confidence, 15 claims, Boeing/Uber cases, HITL routing matrix
- **AR-012 (Trust Moat) ✅ COMPLETE** — 75% confidence, 12 claims, Klarna case, 5 moat types
- **AR-013 (Developer Trust Gap) ✅ COMPLETE** — 72% confidence, developer UX problem not values problem
- **AR-014 (Agent Memory & Context) ← RUNNING** — spawned 02:46, last report in series
- Florian: "Lass es durchlaufen. Lass dir Zeit. Hyperthink. Nichts überstürzen."
- All use locked TEMPLATE-RULES.md + REPORT-TEMPLATE-FINAL.html
- PDF via html-to-pdf.sh ($0)

### CV-Chooser (02:16-running)
- Florian wants Chooser Pattern for CV too — "dann kommen wir schnell zum ziel"
- 12 elements, 3 options each, same UI as Report Chooser
- Universal CV base, swappable per application
- Key feedback on v3: subtitle too specific, summary too generic, Ainary block vague, needs report portfolio link
- CV-CHOOSER.html building parallel to reports

### CV v4 Chooser Decisions (02:41)
- Florian completed all 12 elements in CV-CHOOSER
- Key picks: Header A (remove Green Card, add website/substack/linkedin), Subtitle A, Summary B (Unfair Advantage + AI systems USP), Ainary B (Research-focused + link), 36ZERO A, Earlier Roles A, VC Lab B (but shorter — 2 bullets max), Education B (condensed), Skills B (VC-first), Footer A, Design A, Strategy A (universal + subtitle swap)
- Florian's key insight: AI systems = USP for portfolio startups AND the VC that hires him
- Florian wants link to research reports in CV
- VC Lab proportional to time invested (3mo vs 6yr 36ZERO)
- Mia agreed all 3 points with reasoning

### Meta-Learnings Agent spawned (02:50)
- Analyzing AR-001-013 for actionable learnings for our own system
- Mirror Test: where does Mia/OpenClaw fail per our own research?
- Hypotheses to test + implement

### Downloads Cleanup Assessment (02:50)
- ~600MB safe to delete (Brave.dmg, Cursor.dmg, drive-downloads, duplicates)
- Awaiting Florian's go-ahead
- Last Google Drive upload: Feb 14 23:03 CET (52 files)

### ALL 14 REPORTS COMPLETE (02:57)
- AR-014 (Agent Memory) ✅ — 82% confidence, MINJA attack >95% success, 0/5 frameworks have provenance
- **Full series AR-001 through AR-014 DONE**
- QA range: 79-92/100, Avg ~86

### GitHub Repo PUBLIC (02:58)
- `fziescheus-alt/ainary-platform` set to PUBLIC
- ⚠️ ENTIRE repo is public now — includes website code, memory, everything
- AR-006 + AR-011 in `content/reports/public/`
- TODO: Consider separate research-only repo

### CV v4 + Research Hub COMPLETE (02:58)
- CV v4: `/job-applications/cv-v4-universal.html` + PDF
- Research Hub: `/content/website/research.html` — 14 report cards with links
- Both opened for Florian's review

### AR-006 Shared on GitHub (02:55)
- Best report = AR-006 Security Playbook (QA 92/100)
- Pushed to `content/reports/public/` on GitHub (ainary-platform repo)
- Repo is PRIVATE — Florian needs to make public or deploy to website
- Florian wants to share with a friend

### Meta-Learnings Complete (02:55)
- `content/reports/META-LEARNINGS.md` — 8 failures in our own system per our own research
- 7 hypotheses, 3 implement-today items
- Accountability: H1+H2 by Feb 22 or it's evidence of research-practice gap

### CV v4 + Research Hub Page (02:53)
- Both building in parallel (spawned 02:53)
- CV v4 with all Chooser picks + website/linkedin/substack links
- /research/ hub page with all 14 reports

### API Cost Estimate
- Today's total: ~$60-70 in pure API costs
- 13 reports + CV Chooser + Template Chooser + research + website + misc
- Sonnet for Builder/QA = ~40% savings vs all-Opus

### Nancy
- 00:13 — Nancy messaged wanting to talk, Florian notified via Telegram
- 00:21 — "Call her back in a minute" relayed via iMessage
