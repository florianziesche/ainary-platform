## Session Notes (continued from ~02:00-08:05)

### Website Changes Applied
- **DE→EN Reset (commit 1c4706c)**: Ported DE version 1:1 to English. 3-tab report showcase (AI Readiness, Due Diligence, AI Research) with full report previews. Removed terminal simulator.
- **Full-width layout (80e5911)**: Container 1440px+48px padding, report cards 100% width
- **Pre-launch polish (3166a42)**: 2rem headings, WHITE HIGH-badges, "One AI system. 10 minutes." research header, "Why I built this" moved to bottom
- **Cleanup (c5710a4)**: 35 backup HTML files deleted, newsletter sections removed from article pages
- **Bugfix (84103be)**: Missing space in showcase heading

### Design Research Completed
Key findings from sub-agent research:
1. **BMW/Siemens/Bosch logo trust bar** — biggest quick win, not yet implemented
2. **Hero glow gradient** — radial gold gradient behind hero text
3. **Scroll fade-in animations** — IntersectionObserver based
4. **Typography**: Hero 56-72px, Section headers 36-44px recommended
5. **Max-width 1140px** recommended by research (currently 1440px)

### Terminal Simulator Status
- Terminal simulator (Enter task → Start task → animated output) was REMOVED during DE→EN reset
- Florian noticed it missing at 08:05
- Needs decision: bring it back, keep report showcase, or both
- Code available in git history (pre-reset commits)

### Remaining Before 10:00 Launch
- [ ] Decision on terminal sim vs report showcase
- [ ] "Daily insights" section — Florian mentioned it's missing, unclear what exactly
- [ ] Footer dead links (reports.html, signup.html, about.html)
- [ ] LinkedIn + Substack posts
- [ ] Mobile check

## Session Notes (continued ~08:00-11:12)

### Website Overhaul — Major Changes
- **35 backup HTML files deleted** (c5710a4) — 17,847 lines removed
- **Newsletter sections removed** from all article pages
- **Kreditkarten blog post removed** (DE) — de/article.html deleted + blog.html link removed
- **Terminal Demo restored** below Report Showcase (737b49e)
- **SVG Agent Network added then removed** — Florian didn't like it
- **Input/AI/Output flow header removed** from terminal demo
- **Visual upgrades** (ad48a06): Hero glow, dot grid, scroll fade-in, card glow hover
- **Trust Cards** → white borders, no fill (page bg), subtle hover
- **Fake UI removed**: "Custom Report" + "Share" buttons (all tabs), Research sub-tabs (Prompting/Agents/etc.)
- **KPIs upgraded**: 80%¹ (Anthropic) / ~10 min / 2-3x² (McKinsey) with sources
- **AI Readiness Tab rebuilt** — new mid-market use case (120 employees, 3 locations) with KPI boxes + insight callouts (Surprising/Contrarian/Opportunity)
- **Hero redesigned** — "Multiply your team" 72px white + "We do 80%..." grey subtitle. Paragraph REMOVED (Linear/Palantir style: show don't tell)
- **Tabs**: Active state = white bg + black text (not gold)
- **Research Section**: "Real work. Created by AI. Any topic." + Beta CTA
- **Footer links fixed**: reports→research, about→use-cases

### Typography System (MAJOR)
- **24 different font sizes → 6** (6ac44dc)
- 6-Step Scale: Hero 72px / Section 48px / Card Title 20px / Body 16px / Secondary 14px / Small 12px
- **Minimum 12px (0.75rem) — nothing below. Ever.**
- Body standardized to 16px (1rem) — WCAG compliant
- All headers left-aligned (except hero centered)
- Font analysis: Linear smallest=12px, body=16px. We now match.

### Design System & Skill
- **DESIGN-SYSTEM.md created + updated** in repo — single source of truth
- **website-ui skill created** at skills/website-ui/SKILL.md
- Rulebook rules: 6-step type scale, tab selection (white+black), box headers=17px mono, minimum 12px, left-aligned headers, no fake UI

### Key Decisions
- **Nancy: Do NOT message without Florian's explicit approval** (he said "Nancy nicht antworten. Frage mich zuvor.")
- Nancy wrote: "Doesn't work" + "And I didn't speak to my daughter today" — Florian aware
- **Left-aligned headers** (Linear-style) — all sections except hero
- **Hero paragraph removed** — less text = stronger showcase below
- **16px body** (not 17px) — cleaner, WCAG standard
- **White bg + black text for active tabs** — not gold

### Disk Space
- Freed 3.3 GB (1.6GB→4.9GB free)
- npm cache cleaned (5.4GB), Library/Caches partial, ainary-website-v3 deleted
- Chrome cache (8.5GB) needs manual clearing

### LinkedIn + Substack Posts
- LinkedIn post drafted and ready (website launch)
- Substack post drafted ("One AI System. 10 Minutes. 47 Pages.")
- Neither posted yet — Florian working on website first

### Git HEAD: 9ea425e (as of ~11:10)

---

## Session 2 (~12:50–14:15 CET)

### Website Changes (all committed + pushed)
- **Radical tab shortening** — "Film trailer rule": show best moment, not full report. ~60% less text. `fa44192`
- **Real system stats** — Replaced external KPIs (Anthropic/McKinsey) with verifiable Ainary numbers: <10 min, +30 pages, 5 agents. `dfca6fd`
- **Mobile menu fix** — `.mobile-menu { display:none }` moved to global scope. `cbbf728`
- **Consistency audit** — Removed header/footer duplications across all 3 tabs. Gold callout borders unified. `d2a88d7`
- **Live agent demo** — Terminal shows 5 named agents (Researcher→Synthesizer) with tree structure. `30e38c4`
- **Hero redesign** — Inter-only fonts (Geist never loaded), value subtitle ("We do 80%..."), CTAs reordered (Try it yourself ↓ primary). `d047450`
- **Agent pills grey** — not gold (gold=clickable). `a473e0d`
- **Report IDs corrected** — AR-031, AR-032 from published URLs. `851bdeb`
- **AgentTrust blog article** — `article-agenttrust.html` created + added to blog.html. `d855a83`
- **Language switcher moved** — Nav → Footer (EN·DE), like Palantir. `05d30af`
- **Easter eggs** — Console msg for devs + "trust" keyword in demo. `39d5f40`
- **Shared nav unified** — shared/nav.js updated (Use Cases · Daily Briefing · Blog). daily-brief.html converted from inline nav to shared system. `4c73071`
- **DESIGN-DECISIONS.md created** — All typography, CTA, layout rules documented for post-compaction survival. `36ea074`

### Key Design Decisions
- Header = Scope, Footer = Process (no duplicates in showcase tabs)
- Film trailer rule: one "holy shit" moment per tab
- No Geist font (never loaded, Inter everywhere)
- Value statement > feature list in hero
- "Try it yourself ↓" primary CTA (white/black), "Get in touch" secondary (gold)
- No language in nav (footer only, like Palantir/McKinsey/BCG)
- Agent pills grey not gold (gold = clickable)
- Callout borders: rgba(200,170,80,0.4) consistently

### Git HEAD: 4c73071 (as of ~14:15)
### Deploy Status: Vercel free limit hit. Reminder set for 16:35 CET to auto-deploy.
### AgentTrust Launch: Posts ready in content/launch-posts-agenttrust.md. HN target was 14:00 CET — not yet posted.

### ⭐ Reference Outcome: article-agenttrust.html
- Florian said "Amazing" — this is the gold standard for all future articles
- Key pattern: Report DNA (E/I/J/A badges, confidence card, source citations, pipeline tree) + Website Character (dark theme, black cards with white borders, gold accents, narrative flow, fade-in)
- Documented fully in DESIGN-DECISIONS.md under "Article Template"
- Reusable CSS classes: .cb, .stat-row, .confidence-card, .pipeline, .badge-legend

### Blog → "Building in Public" Redesign (~15:25-15:45)
- **"Blog" → "Building in Public"** — Florian's name. Not "Now" (Linear's brand, copying feels like copying). Building in Public IS Florian's story: solo founder, open source reports, transparent confidence scores.
- **Linear-inspired layout** — H1 statement (3.5rem/600), no subtitle, no description. Content speaks. Featured article (flat, not card), article rows (date|content grid), section dividers with "See all →" links.
- **3 sections** like Linear: Featured + Articles, Published Research (with confidence scores), From the Daily Brief
- **Nav updated**: `★ Ainary   Daily Briefing · Building in Public   [Get in touch]`
- **Tabs**: pill-style (border-radius 100px), Resources tab disabled ("soon")
- **Row hover**: bg 0.015 + negative margin expand (Linear pattern)
- **Borders**: 0.04 (almost invisible, Linear-light), not 0.12

### Article Template Upgrade (~15:45-15:55)
- **article-100-agents.html + article-one-person-company.html** → Reference Template
  - Removed: Geist font, ~500 lines old CSS, inline nav, gold badges, hero SVGs, related cards, newsletter, tool CTA
  - Added: E/I/J/A badges on claims, badge legend, "Human + AI generated", fade-ins, Inter/Mono
  - article-100-agents: Pipeline tree (10 strategies), stat boxes (33K/10/6)
  - article-one-person-company: Stat boxes (3500 LOC/5 articles/18 feeds)
  - **-1,734 lines, +368 lines** total
- **article-agenttrust.html editorial upgrade**
  - Header: left → centered (magazine feel)
  - Added subtitle line
  - Body text: 1rem → 1.05rem
  - "Human + AI" as pill badge
  - "More from Ainary" bottom section (3 article rows, Linear-style)
  - Blockquote: added border-radius

### Florian's Decision Patterns (observed today)
- **"Quality >>> Speed"** — "The template is the product. We get faster when the quality is right, and slower when we focus on speed." One article at a time with review, not batch. Don't optimize for throughput, optimize for standard.
- **Prefers "authentic over borrowed"** — rejected "Now" because it's Linear's word. Chose "Building in Public" because it's HIS story.
- **"At least as good or better"** — won't accept a conceptually better version if it LOOKS worse. Design quality is non-negotiable.
- **Compares by opening files side-by-side** — downloads HTMLs, opens locally, compares visually
- **Grey > Gold for non-clickable elements** — confirmed again on article badges
- **Wants transparency baked in** — "Human + AI generated" label on all articles, binary star origin story
- **Binary Star origin** — Ainary = AI + Binary (Star). Two bodies in orbit, co-evolving. Cosmic science + Human-AI synergy. Wants this in About section.
- **Substack = personal channel** — Website = Ainary (company), Substack = Florian (person). Different voices.

### Git HEAD: a8cf72d (as of ~15:55)
### Commits since last deploy (750e406): ~25+ pending

### Still TODO
- Deploy when Vercel resets (~16:30 CET)
- Binary Star origin story → "Why I built this" section
- Apply editorial upgrade to article-100-agents + article-one-person-company (centered header, subtitle, More section)
- DE pages still outdated (11 pages)
- Footer dead links (reports.html, signup.html, about.html)
- Use-cases.html redesign (planned for weekend)
- 14 CNC emails + 19 VC apps still unsent (12+ days overdue)

### "Why I built this" — Binary Star Origin Story (~16:05)
- **Implemented on index.html** — Binary star metaphor + 36ZERO Vision link + "my co-founder and team outproduce large teams"
- **36ZERO Vision**: linked to https://36zerovision.com/ — white text, subtle underline, not gold (not a CTA)
- **Text reduced**: 5 paragraphs → 3. Tighter, one voice. Removed generic "routine work eats hours" copy.
- **"my old team" → "large teams"** — Florian's correction: "my old team" makes HIS team look bad. "large teams" = industry comparison.
- **"my co-founder and team"** — gives credit to everyone, not just one person

### Article Navigation Standard (~16:15-16:25)
- **Breadcrumb**: `← Building in Public` on all articles (Mono 0.75rem, muted). Links to blog.html.
- **Copy link button**: After CTA section, pill style (border-radius 100px). "Copied ✓" gold feedback, 2s reset.
- **Research-backed**: Linear articles have breadcrumbs (`Now > Craft`) + "Copy link" as ONLY share action. No redundant Home/Blog/Substack links.
- **Applied to**: article-agenttrust ✅, article-100-agents ✅, article-one-person-company ✅
- **Florian approved**: "Deine Empfehlung ist gut. Standard documentierung und für alle anwenden."

### Article Layout Decision: Not One-Size-Fits-All
- **article-agenttrust** = v2 (centered, editorial, subtitle, More section) — research/strategy article
- **article-one-person-company** = v1 (left-aligned, simpler) — Florian explicitly preferred this version
- **article-100-agents** = v2 (centered) — architecture article
- **Lesson**: "The tone determines the layout." Not every article needs the same template.

### Key Florian Patterns (new)
- **"Quality >>> Speed"** — "The template is the product. We get faster when the quality is right, and slower when we focus on speed." One at a time with review.
- **Credits matter** — "my old team" sounds like team was bad. "large teams" = comparing to industry. "my co-founder AND team" = everyone gets credit.
- **Too many links = no decision** — Florian asked about 5+ footer links. Research showed: Linear uses ONLY "Copy link". Fewer options = clearer action.
- **Downloads vs Project folder** — Florian opens HTMLs from Downloads → relative links break. Always open from project folder or on server.

### Binary Star Images Generated (~15:55)
- **4 variants** via GPT Image 1 (gpt-image-1, quality high, 1536x1024)
- Stored: `assets/images/` (original) + `assets/images/variants/` (3 variants)
- Gold star (Human) + Silver star (AI) + binary code waves
- Gemini quota exhausted (free tier)
- **Still pending**: Florian's choice of which variant + og:image implementation

### Nancy WiFi (~16:10)
- Nancy messaged asking for WiFi password (no data left)
- Relayed to Florian via Telegram
- **Rule reminder**: Don't share private info, relay request to Florian

### Git HEAD: 9682d75 (as of ~16:25)
### Commits since last deploy (750e406): ~30+ pending
### Deploy: Vercel limit should reset ~16:30 CET

---

## Session 2 (~16:27–17:10)

### Website Cleanup & Polish
- **Consistency audit**: Found footer said "Blog" not "Building in Public", dead use-cases.html link
- **Footer fixed** (shared/footer.js): "Blog" → "Building in Public", use-cases → daily-brief as "Daily Briefing"
- **9 dead pages archived** to `archive/`: demo-ai-systems, pricing-*, report, article, reports, quality, use-cases
- **Reading progress bar** added to all 3 articles (2px gold, fixed top)
- **Anchor links on H2s** added to all 3 articles (auto-ID, # on hover)
- **og:image** (binary-star-hero.png) added to all 3 articles
- **Competitor research**: Palantir (video hero), Stripe (gradient mesh), Linear (bento grid), McKinsey (hero images)
- **Deployed to Vercel** ✅ → ainaryventures.com live

### About Text Revision (APPROVED ~17:00)
- "12 years" → "more than 10 years" (36ZERO founded 2019, not 12 years)
- Removed 36ZERO Vision link (LinkedIn tells that story)
- Removed Binary Star origin paragraph (too loud for frontpage → About page)
- **Approved text** (2 paragraphs):
  > I spent more than 10 years building algorithms, software, computer vision & AI systems. Raised capital. Led teams. Then I watched my co-founder and team outproduce large teams.
  > Ainary exists because the next wave of intelligence won't come from bigger models. It'll come from better partnerships between humans and machines.
- Committed: `a84fee3`

### Binary Star Canvas Animation
- **v1**: Sub-agent created (binary-star-component.js + preview HTML). Two stars (Gold/Silver) orbiting with particle streams.
- **Feedback**: "not bad, but connection/line in the middle is too noisy"
- **v2**: Wrote BINARY_STAR_STANDARD.md first. Then improved:
  - Stream particles 250 → 30 (88% reduction)
  - Replaced noisy particles with 4-layer smooth bezier luminous bridge
  - Layers: outer glow (12px), main (4px), core (1.5px), secondary offset
  - All layers breathe (sin pulse oscillation)
  - Gradient: gold → white → silver
- Committed: `c09cfc2`
- **Status**: v2 sent to Florian, awaiting review

### Disk Cleanup (~16:44)
- Chrome Cache ~4.6GB, npm ~1.7GB, OpenAI ~375MB, Notion ~267MB, Logs ~350MB
- **Result: 1.4GB → 7.1GB free**

### Ideas Noted
- Terminal `/present acme-corp` → generates client presentation (show effect)
- DE pages need update after EN is finalized

### Self-Evolution Retrospective
- Saved to Obsidian: `System_OS/Mia Self-Evolution Retrospektive 2026-02-16.md`
- Key finding: "Better at writing protocols than living them"
- 0 weekly reviews executed out of 6 weeks
- P-EX-01 (Send First) violated 12+ days
- Recommendation: weekly review cron, morning send cron, monthly USER.md co-review

### Git HEAD: c09cfc2
### Deploy status: Last deploy was successful (~16:40), may need redeploy after about text change

---

## Session 3 (~17:00–18:15)

### Binary Star Animation v3 (CSS GPU-Blur)
- **v2 feedback**: "not bad but not agency level"
- **Honest assessment**: Canvas 2D has a ceiling. shadowBlur = CPU, never looks "leuchtend"
- **v3 approach**: CSS orbs + `filter:blur(80px)` (GPU) + film grain + mouse parallax + vignette
- Created `binary-star-v3.html` + `binary-star-v3.css`
- **Integrated into index.html hero** (~17:20)
- Iterated: orbs too bright (text unreadable) → dimmed + moved lower → moved closer + higher → spread 120px apart centered on heading
- **Key insight**: "Best agency animations use simplest techniques executed perfectly" (Vercel/Linear use CSS blur, not WebGL)

### About Page Complete Rewrite
- Binary Star origin story moved here (was "too loud" for frontpage)
- Mission: "Build intelligence tools that multiply what one person can achieve. Decisions that compound."
- Vision: "A world where your output and the quality of your decisions aren't limited by the size of your team. Where a founder with the right tools outperforms a company."
- "What I Believe" (changed from "We" → "I", Ainary = solo founder)
- How It Works: conceptual (Define → Build → Orchestrate), not agent-list
- **Trust as a currency** — "Trust isn't a feature — it's the unit of exchange"
- Einstein quote after Mission/Vision
- Founder meta: "Based in NYC · Munich" (general, no revenue/client details)
- Removed redundant "Get in Touch" (footer CTA handles it)

### Navigation & Footer Changes
- **Daily Briefing removed from nav + footer** — Easter egg only via terminal `ainary` command
- **"Get in touch" → contact.html** (was direct Calendly link)
- **Research → index.html#showcase-research** (was external GitHub link)
- **About added to footer** under Explore
- Footer: Building in Public · Research · About | LinkedIn · Substack · GitHub | Privacy · Terms · Imprint

### Contact Page (New)
- Topic-based form: Beta Access (5 spots), Research, Consulting, Partnership, Schedule a Call, Other
- "Schedule a Call" → hides form, shows Calendly card
- "Beta Access" → message optional, gold scarcity note
- JS submission via Web3Forms API + mailto fallback
- **Florian registered at web3forms.com** — awaiting access key

### Design Audit & Fixes
- **🔴 Font system fix**: shared/styles.css had `--font-display: Geist` but Geist wasn't loaded. Changed to Inter + JetBrains Mono (what's actually loaded)
- Section spacing: blog + articles 120px → 160px
- blog.html H1: 3.5rem → 3rem (consistent)
- "More from Ainary" added to article-one-person-company (was missing)
- Ambient stars: much more subtle (barely visible)
- About page spacing: 80px between sections (consistent)
- Blockquote style added to shared/styles.css (gold border, italic)

### I/We Consistency
- **Rule**: Ainary = solo founder → "I" on About, "Ainary" as system voice on landing page
- "We do 80%" on landing page = OK (product voice)
- About page: all "we" → "I" or "Ainary"

### Key Decisions
- **Terminal Easter Egg**: `ainary` → Daily Brief. Discovery > Navigation.
- **"12 years" → "more than 10 years"** — approved and implemented
- **No 36ZERO link on frontpage** — LinkedIn tells that story
- **CSS blur >>> Canvas 2D** for animations — GPU-accelerated, simpler, better
- **Beta limit: 5 spots** (start small, expand to 10)
- **Contact form > direct Calendly** — own domain = control the experience
- **Resources page idea** — Innovationsförderung, AI Stack, Research, Templates. "You give, you get."

### Competitive Research

### Key Decisions
- **No email gate before articles** — B2B hates gates, SEO killer, trust destroyer

- **OpenAI API $5** — better than $250 Google AI Ultra or $20 ChatGPT Plus
- **HN Post timing** — Tuesday/Wednesday 15-17 CET optimal
- **Resources = super valuable** — Prompt Library + Vibe Coding sections (shareable content)

### Nancy Message (~21:38)
- Nancy (+16462260465) contacted via WhatsApp asking me to answer her messages
- Florian has NOT yet approved — waiting for his OK
- Critical rule: never message contacts without explicit approval

### Session 4 — Späte Ergänzungen (~21:00-21:40)

#### Resources Page v2 — Live
- Grants nach oben (erste Section), regional organisiert: Federal, Bayern, Sachsen
- Bayern: Start?Zuschuss! (€36K), Digitalbonus (€200K), KI Innovation Lab

#### Legal Pages — Live
- privacy.html, terms.html, imprint.html
- Impressum: Florian Ziesche, Schloßbergstr. 2, 81549 München
- KEIN LLC — nur Projektname "Ainary Ventures" ohne Rechtsform
- Entscheidung: LLC macht keinen Sinn mit Münchner Adresse (US Rechtsform)

#### Logo
- 9 Varianten generiert (3 Konzepte × 3 Varianten)
- A: Binary Star Abstract, B: Monogram "A", C: Wordmark "ainary"
- Florian findet alle nicht gut genug — "nicht clever, nicht auf dem Level"
- Neuer Ansatz: SVG mit Code statt AI Image Gen
- 4 Konzept-Ideen: (1) A als Binary Star Orbits, (2) Negativraum, (3) Der Dot, (4) Overlapping mit Bedeutung
- Florian hat noch nicht gewählt

#### Nächste Tasks (priorisiert)
1. **Toolkit 2-Column Grid** — Cards statt Liste, max-width 800px für Toolkit
2. **Trust Scores für Tools** — Bars + Hover-Breakdown + Fußnote Methodik
3. **Cookie Banner** — minimaler eigener Banner
4. **Vercel Analytics** — 1 Script-Tag, kostenlos, keine Cookies
5. **Logo** — SVG-Code basiert, wartet auf Florinas Konzept-Wahl
6. **DE-Übersetzung** — 4 Seiten in /de/ erstellt, noch nicht deployed/reviewed
7. **Nancy** — hat via WhatsApp kontaktiert, wartet auf Florians OK

#### Design System Learnings
- KEINE Farben außer Gold (#c8aa50) + Graustufen — alles andere bricht Design
- Tags: neutral grau, nicht farbcodiert
- max-width: 680px für Content, 800px für Grids (wie Linear/Stripe)

#### Git HEAD: 7309e73

### Resources Page Final State (~22:08)
- v4 deployed: Linear-level clarity
- Featured #1 per category (name, score, 1 sentence, link)
- Rest compressed: "ChatGPT · 90% | Perplexity · 82% | Gemini · 78%"
- White trust bars (NOT gold)
- No cards, no boxes, no backgrounds
- All tags neutral gray
- 680px consistent
- Methodology footnote at bottom
- Design rule confirmed: NO gold except link hover + accent
- Florian approved this version

### Bürgermeister Schlottwitz (~22:10)
- Florian hat heute mit dem Bürgermeister gesprochen
- Bürgermeister erwartet WhatsApp-Nachricht von Florian
- Einladung ins Rathaus — Terminabsprache über WhatsApp
- Kontext: vermutlich Schlottwitz/Glashütte (aktueller Aufenthaltsort)
- TODO: Florian muss WhatsApp schicken + Termin vereinbaren

### Late Session (~22:00-22:14)

#### Resources Page Iterations (v1→v4)
- v1: Cards with colored tags (rejected — rainbow, not design system)
- v2: 2-column cards with trust scores (rejected — cards are noise)
- v3: Simple list, white trust bars, curated 13 tools (better but too much text)
- v4 FINAL: Linear-level clarity — Featured #1 per category (name, score, 1 sentence, link), rest compressed ("ChatGPT · 90% | Perplexity · 82%")
- ALL tags: plain gray text, no boxes/borders, right-aligned (like % scores)
- Trust bars: WHITE fill rgba(255,255,255,0.4), NOT gold
- 680px max-width everywhere, no 800px exceptions
- No "Best for" lines (filler — our audience knows these tools)

#### Design System Rules CONFIRMED
- NO colored tags anywhere — plain gray mono text only
- NO cards/boxes with backgrounds on list items
- Gold ONLY for link hover + accent, nothing else
- Tags = right-aligned, plain text (like toolkit % scores)
- Less is more: every item must earn its spot
- Anthropic/Linear style = the benchmark

#### Logo Status
- AI Image Gen (9 variants) rejected — "not clever, not on our level"
- 4 SVG concepts proposed: (1) A as Binary Star Orbits, (2) Negative space, (3) The Dot (radical minimal), (4) Overlapping circles with meaning
- Florian hasn't chosen yet
- Next step: build in SVG code, not image gen

#### Bürgermeister Schlottwitz
- Florian spoke with mayor today
- Mayor expects WhatsApp from Florian
- Invited to Rathaus — schedule via WhatsApp
- Florian needs to send message

#### Nancy
- Contacted via WhatsApp asking for WiFi password
- Escalated ("should I ask the Italian guy or Steffi")
- Florian has NOT approved me responding to her
- STILL BLOCKED — do not message without explicit OK

#### Git HEAD: ffd6876
#### Morning Briefing: MORNING_BRIEFING_2026-02-17.md (sent to florian@ainaryventures.com)

### Late Night Session Part 2 (~22:14-23:49)

#### Website Fixes Deployed
- **Blog article badges**: border removed, plain gray text (all 6 articles EN+DE)
- **Research links fixed**: AR-001→/research/state-of-agent-trust-2026/, AR-031→/research/personal-ai-stack-2026/, AR-032→/research/knowledge-compounding-2026/. Removed all github.io links.
- **Contact/Feedback links**: All 3 research reports → /contact.html (was mailto:)
- **Legal page links**: Gold default → text-secondary default, gold on hover only
- **Nav logo underline**: Fixed with inline text-decoration:none in nav.js
- **DE imprint**: Fixed to München address, removed LLC, removed card box
- **DE complete translation**: shared/footer.js + nav.js language-aware, all pages checked

#### Design Rules CONFIRMED (session)
- **Links**: text-secondary default, accent on hover ONLY. No permanent gold links.
- **Tags/Badges**: No borders, no backgrounds, plain gray mono text everywhere
- **Tab headers/footers**: All same font (0.75rem mono muted), same padding (16px 40px)
- **Tab meta badges**: No box/border, plain text
- **Cards/Boxes**: Avoid on list items. Plain lists preferred.

#### Use-Case Tabs Unified
- Right column: ALL tabs now use dot-ratings (4 criteria each)
- Blockquote label: ALL tabs use "KEY INSIGHT" with gold border
- Footer: ALL tabs have CTA link (mono, muted, not gold)
- Rollback tag: `pre-tab-consistency`

#### Tagline DECIDED
- **Final**: "AI strategy - research - implementation. By someone who built the systems first."
- Rejected: "From a founder-operator who delivers" (too LinkedIn-bio, "founder-operator" is buzzword)
- Not yet deployed to website/reports

#### Bürgermeister
- Florian spoke with mayor of Schlottwitz
- Expects WhatsApp from Florian
- Invited to Rathaus
- DE website needed for this → deployed

#### Nancy
- Messaged 4 times (WiFi password, "??", "Does not work", transport to see Floriana)
- Florian has NOT approved response
- STILL BLOCKED

#### Disk Space
- cache-trace.jsonl (44GB) deleted — was debug log, not critical
- main.sqlite (11GB) kept — memory database
- Browser cache (870MB) deleted
- Trash emptied
- APFS delayed space release — should free ~44GB after snapshot expires
- Upload to Google Drive failed for large files (only gateway.err.log uploaded)
- Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i18EceuklsqbB38fdCp5eXM6HRbfIjfa

#### Git HEAD: 87d5f1c

### Tab Info-Redundanz Analyse (~23:58)
- Readiness: "< 5 min" in header + "4 min 32 sec" in footer = doppelt
- Due Diligence: "< 5 min" in header AND footer = identisch doppelt
- Florians Empfehlung bestätigt: Header = WAS (Typ + Umfang), Footer = WIE (Process + CTA)
- Fix: Header rechts = pages + sources, Footer links = agents + time + rounds
- Status: NOT YET DEPLOYED — waiting for Florian's OK
