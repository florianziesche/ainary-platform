## Session Notes (continued from ~02:00-08:05)

### Website Changes Applied
- **DE→EN Reset (commit 1c4706c)**: Ported DE version 1:1 to English. 3-tab report showcase (AI Readiness, Due Diligence, AI Research) with full report previews. Removed terminal simulator.
- **Full-width layout (80e5911)**: Container 1440px+48px padding, report cards 100% width
- **Pre-launch polish (3166a42)**: 2rem headings, WHITE HIGH-badges, "One AI system. 10 minutes." research header, "Why I built this" moved to bottom
- **Cleanup (c5710a4)**: 35 backup HTML files deleted, newsletter sections removed from article pages
- **Bugfix (84103be)**: Missing space in showcase heading

### Design Research Completed
Key findings from sub-agent research:
1. **BMW/Siemens/Bosch logo trust bar** — biggest quick win, not yet implemented
2. **Hero glow gradient** — radial gold gradient behind hero text
3. **Scroll fade-in animations** — IntersectionObserver based
4. **Typography**: Hero 56-72px, Section headers 36-44px recommended
5. **Max-width 1140px** recommended by research (currently 1440px)

### Terminal Simulator Status
- Terminal simulator (Enter task → Start task → animated output) was REMOVED during DE→EN reset
- Florian noticed it missing at 08:05
- Needs decision: bring it back, keep report showcase, or both
- Code available in git history (pre-reset commits)

### Remaining Before 10:00 Launch
- [ ] Decision on terminal sim vs report showcase
- [ ] "Daily insights" section — Florian mentioned it's missing, unclear what exactly
- [ ] Footer dead links (reports.html, signup.html, about.html)
- [ ] LinkedIn + Substack posts
- [ ] Mobile check
