## Session Notes (continued from ~02:00-08:05)

### Website Changes Applied
- **DE→EN Reset (commit 1c4706c)**: Ported DE version 1:1 to English. 3-tab report showcase (AI Readiness, Due Diligence, AI Research) with full report previews. Removed terminal simulator.
- **Full-width layout (80e5911)**: Container 1440px+48px padding, report cards 100% width
- **Pre-launch polish (3166a42)**: 2rem headings, WHITE HIGH-badges, "One AI system. 10 minutes." research header, "Why I built this" moved to bottom
- **Cleanup (c5710a4)**: 35 backup HTML files deleted, newsletter sections removed from article pages
- **Bugfix (84103be)**: Missing space in showcase heading

### Design Research Completed
Key findings from sub-agent research:
1. **BMW/Siemens/Bosch logo trust bar** — biggest quick win, not yet implemented
2. **Hero glow gradient** — radial gold gradient behind hero text
3. **Scroll fade-in animations** — IntersectionObserver based
4. **Typography**: Hero 56-72px, Section headers 36-44px recommended
5. **Max-width 1140px** recommended by research (currently 1440px)

### Terminal Simulator Status
- Terminal simulator (Enter task → Start task → animated output) was REMOVED during DE→EN reset
- Florian noticed it missing at 08:05
- Needs decision: bring it back, keep report showcase, or both
- Code available in git history (pre-reset commits)

### Remaining Before 10:00 Launch
- [ ] Decision on terminal sim vs report showcase
- [ ] "Daily insights" section — Florian mentioned it's missing, unclear what exactly
- [ ] Footer dead links (reports.html, signup.html, about.html)
- [ ] LinkedIn + Substack posts
- [ ] Mobile check

## Session Notes (continued ~08:00-11:12)

### Website Overhaul — Major Changes
- **35 backup HTML files deleted** (c5710a4) — 17,847 lines removed
- **Newsletter sections removed** from all article pages
- **Kreditkarten blog post removed** (DE) — de/article.html deleted + blog.html link removed
- **Terminal Demo restored** below Report Showcase (737b49e)
- **SVG Agent Network added then removed** — Florian didn't like it
- **Input/AI/Output flow header removed** from terminal demo
- **Visual upgrades** (ad48a06): Hero glow, dot grid, scroll fade-in, card glow hover
- **Trust Cards** → white borders, no fill (page bg), subtle hover
- **Fake UI removed**: "Custom Report" + "Share" buttons (all tabs), Research sub-tabs (Prompting/Agents/etc.)
- **KPIs upgraded**: 80%¹ (Anthropic) / ~10 min / 2-3x² (McKinsey) with sources
- **AI Readiness Tab rebuilt** — new mid-market use case (120 employees, 3 locations) with KPI boxes + insight callouts (Surprising/Contrarian/Opportunity)
- **Hero redesigned** — "Multiply your team" 72px white + "We do 80%..." grey subtitle. Paragraph REMOVED (Linear/Palantir style: show don't tell)
- **Tabs**: Active state = white bg + black text (not gold)
- **Research Section**: "Real work. Created by AI. Any topic." + Beta CTA
- **Footer links fixed**: reports→research, about→use-cases

### Typography System (MAJOR)
- **24 different font sizes → 6** (6ac44dc)
- 6-Step Scale: Hero 72px / Section 48px / Card Title 20px / Body 16px / Secondary 14px / Small 12px
- **Minimum 12px (0.75rem) — nothing below. Ever.**
- Body standardized to 16px (1rem) — WCAG compliant
- All headers left-aligned (except hero centered)
- Font analysis: Linear smallest=12px, body=16px. We now match.

### Design System & Skill
- **DESIGN-SYSTEM.md created + updated** in repo — single source of truth
- **website-ui skill created** at skills/website-ui/SKILL.md
- Rulebook rules: 6-step type scale, tab selection (white+black), box headers=17px mono, minimum 12px, left-aligned headers, no fake UI

### Key Decisions
- **Nancy: Do NOT message without Florian's explicit approval** (he said "Nancy nicht antworten. Frage mich zuvor.")
- Nancy wrote: "Doesn't work" + "And I didn't speak to my daughter today" — Florian aware
- **Left-aligned headers** (Linear-style) — all sections except hero
- **Hero paragraph removed** — less text = stronger showcase below
- **16px body** (not 17px) — cleaner, WCAG standard
- **White bg + black text for active tabs** — not gold

### Disk Space
- Freed 3.3 GB (1.6GB→4.9GB free)
- npm cache cleaned (5.4GB), Library/Caches partial, ainary-website-v3 deleted
- Chrome cache (8.5GB) needs manual clearing

### LinkedIn + Substack Posts
- LinkedIn post drafted and ready (website launch)
- Substack post drafted ("One AI System. 10 Minutes. 47 Pages.")
- Neither posted yet — Florian working on website first

### Git HEAD: 9ea425e (as of ~11:10)

---

## Session 2 (~12:50–14:15 CET)

### Website Changes (all committed + pushed)
- **Radical tab shortening** — "Film trailer rule": show best moment, not full report. ~60% less text. `fa44192`
- **Real system stats** — Replaced external KPIs (Anthropic/McKinsey) with verifiable Ainary numbers: <10 min, +30 pages, 5 agents. `dfca6fd`
- **Mobile menu fix** — `.mobile-menu { display:none }` moved to global scope. `cbbf728`
- **Consistency audit** — Removed header/footer duplications across all 3 tabs. Gold callout borders unified. `d2a88d7`
- **Live agent demo** — Terminal shows 5 named agents (Researcher→Synthesizer) with tree structure. `30e38c4`
- **Hero redesign** — Inter-only fonts (Geist never loaded), value subtitle ("We do 80%..."), CTAs reordered (Try it yourself ↓ primary). `d047450`
- **Agent pills grey** — not gold (gold=clickable). `a473e0d`
- **Report IDs corrected** — AR-031, AR-032 from published URLs. `851bdeb`
- **AgentTrust blog article** — `article-agenttrust.html` created + added to blog.html. `d855a83`
- **Language switcher moved** — Nav → Footer (EN·DE), like Palantir. `05d30af`
- **Easter eggs** — Console msg for devs + "trust" keyword in demo. `39d5f40`
- **Shared nav unified** — shared/nav.js updated (Use Cases · Daily Briefing · Blog). daily-brief.html converted from inline nav to shared system. `4c73071`
- **DESIGN-DECISIONS.md created** — All typography, CTA, layout rules documented for post-compaction survival. `36ea074`

### Key Design Decisions
- Header = Scope, Footer = Process (no duplicates in showcase tabs)
- Film trailer rule: one "holy shit" moment per tab
- No Geist font (never loaded, Inter everywhere)
- Value statement > feature list in hero
- "Try it yourself ↓" primary CTA (white/black), "Get in touch" secondary (gold)
- No language in nav (footer only, like Palantir/McKinsey/BCG)
- Agent pills grey not gold (gold = clickable)
- Callout borders: rgba(200,170,80,0.4) consistently

### Git HEAD: 4c73071 (as of ~14:15)
### Deploy Status: Vercel free limit hit. Reminder set for 16:35 CET to auto-deploy.
### AgentTrust Launch: Posts ready in content/launch-posts-agenttrust.md. HN target was 14:00 CET — not yet posted.

### ⭐ Reference Outcome: article-agenttrust.html
- Florian said "Amazing" — this is the gold standard for all future articles
- Key pattern: Report DNA (E/I/J/A badges, confidence card, source citations, pipeline tree) + Website Character (dark theme, black cards with white borders, gold accents, narrative flow, fade-in)
- Documented fully in DESIGN-DECISIONS.md under "Article Template"
- Reusable CSS classes: .cb, .stat-row, .confidence-card, .pipeline, .badge-legend

### Blog → "Building in Public" Redesign (~15:25-15:45)
- **"Blog" → "Building in Public"** — Florian's name. Not "Now" (Linear's brand, copying feels like copying). Building in Public IS Florian's story: solo founder, open source reports, transparent confidence scores.
- **Linear-inspired layout** — H1 statement (3.5rem/600), no subtitle, no description. Content speaks. Featured article (flat, not card), article rows (date|content grid), section dividers with "See all →" links.
- **3 sections** like Linear: Featured + Articles, Published Research (with confidence scores), From the Daily Brief
- **Nav updated**: `★ Ainary   Daily Briefing · Building in Public   [Get in touch]`
- **Tabs**: pill-style (border-radius 100px), Resources tab disabled ("soon")
- **Row hover**: bg 0.015 + negative margin expand (Linear pattern)
- **Borders**: 0.04 (almost invisible, Linear-light), not 0.12

### Article Template Upgrade (~15:45-15:55)
- **article-100-agents.html + article-one-person-company.html** → Reference Template
  - Removed: Geist font, ~500 lines old CSS, inline nav, gold badges, hero SVGs, related cards, newsletter, tool CTA
  - Added: E/I/J/A badges on claims, badge legend, "Human + AI generated", fade-ins, Inter/Mono
  - article-100-agents: Pipeline tree (10 strategies), stat boxes (33K/10/6)
  - article-one-person-company: Stat boxes (3500 LOC/5 articles/18 feeds)
  - **-1,734 lines, +368 lines** total
- **article-agenttrust.html editorial upgrade**
  - Header: left → centered (magazine feel)
  - Added subtitle line
  - Body text: 1rem → 1.05rem
  - "Human + AI" as pill badge
  - "More from Ainary" bottom section (3 article rows, Linear-style)
  - Blockquote: added border-radius

### Florian's Decision Patterns (observed today)
- **"Quality >>> Speed"** — "The template is the product. We get faster when the quality is right, and slower when we focus on speed." One article at a time with review, not batch. Don't optimize for throughput, optimize for standard.
- **Prefers "authentic over borrowed"** — rejected "Now" because it's Linear's word. Chose "Building in Public" because it's HIS story.
- **"At least as good or better"** — won't accept a conceptually better version if it LOOKS worse. Design quality is non-negotiable.
- **Compares by opening files side-by-side** — downloads HTMLs, opens locally, compares visually
- **Grey > Gold for non-clickable elements** — confirmed again on article badges
- **Wants transparency baked in** — "Human + AI generated" label on all articles, binary star origin story
- **Binary Star origin** — Ainary = AI + Binary (Star). Two bodies in orbit, co-evolving. Cosmic science + Human-AI synergy. Wants this in About section.
- **Substack = personal channel** — Website = Ainary (company), Substack = Florian (person). Different voices.

### Git HEAD: a8cf72d (as of ~15:55)
### Commits since last deploy (750e406): ~25+ pending

### Still TODO
- Deploy when Vercel resets (~16:30 CET)
- Binary Star origin story → "Why I built this" section
- Apply editorial upgrade to article-100-agents + article-one-person-company (centered header, subtitle, More section)
- DE pages still outdated (11 pages)
- Footer dead links (reports.html, signup.html, about.html)
- Use-cases.html redesign (planned for weekend)
- 14 CNC emails + 19 VC apps still unsent (12+ days overdue)
