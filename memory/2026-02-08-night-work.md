## PRIORITY 1: CNC Planner Revenue Engine (Target: €100K ARR)

### Task 1.1: Lead Enrichment — Find 10 MORE High-Intent Leads

**Target:** Sachsen + Thüringen (local = trust)
**Criteria:** 5-50 employees, CNC Fräsen/Drehen, Lohnfertigung

Status: ⬜ Starting...

### Task 1.2: GMT Glashütte Deep Research
**Why:** MEMORY.md mentions them, located 5km from Florian's current location
**Angle:** Uhrenindustrie = Präzision + Quality + close neighbor
**Goal:** Personalized outreach angle beyond template

Status: ⬜ Starting...

### Task 1.3: Daniel Daum (Freie Presse) Connection Clarification
**Note:** MEMORY says "Family connection (klären!)"

Status: ⬜ Starting...

Status: ⬜ Starting...

### Task 4.2: LinkedIn Post from Sequoia Article
**Source:** Sequoia AGI article v2 (EN + DE, 2,200 words)
**Task:** Extract 1 punchy LinkedIn post (1000-1300 chars)

## 🎯 FLORIAN'S MONDAY MORNING ACTIONS (Zero Friction)

**1. CNC Outreach (15 minutes)**
- GMT Glashütte — call 035053-47151, mention local proximity
- 3 emails from existing READY-TO-SEND list
- **Why:** Local demo opportunity, warm angle

**2. Consulting Outreach (10 minutes)**
- IHK Chemnitz — call 0371 6900-0, ask for "Ansprechpartner Digitalisierung"
- 1 email to top consulting target (attach Legal AI case study PDF)
- **Why:** Geographic proximity, IHK = multiplier effect

**3. VC Application (30 minutes)**
- HOF Capital — review cover letter, refine with research notes
- Submit by EOD Monday (first-wave advantage)
- **Why:** Perfect fit, 20-day deadline, early applicants win

**4. Content Publish (5 minutes)**
- Review LinkedIn post
- Schedule for Monday 10:00 CET
- **Why:** Mo/Wed/Fri cadence, momentum from Article #1

**Total Monday execution time: 60 minutes**  
**Result: 5+ sends, 1 VC application, 1 content publish**

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What Worked
- **Targeted research > broad scraping** — 10 high-quality leads > 50 generic ones
- **Templates with placeholders** — IHK/HWK template ready, just needs names
- **Case study as credibility** — Legal AI 1-pager = instant proof for consulting emails
- **Deal memo prep** — Having writing sample ready = competitive advantage

### Blocks Identified
1. **Daniel Daum:** Family connection unclear → NEED FLORIAN CLARIFICATION before outreach
2. **IHK/HWK contacts:** Framework ready, specific names need manual research (LinkedIn or phone call)
3. **GMT Glashütte:** Website unknown, GF name unknown → can still call + email via form

### Revenue Impact Estimate
If Monday actions execute:
- 4 CNC emails × 5% conversion × €149/mo = ~€30/mo potential
- 1 IHK connection × 20% Workshop chance × €3,500 = €700 expected value
- 1 VC app × 2% interview rate = 0.02 interviews (lottery ticket)
- 1 LinkedIn post × 5K impressions × 0.1% inbound = 5 leads

**Not millions. But ZERO → SOMETHING.**
