# 🧠 Intelligence Brief — Feb 7, 2026

## 1️⃣ MUST-KNOW:
AI is brutally sorting SaaS into winners/losers based on one metric: growth rate. Vertical software fell 43% this year vs DevTools at 21%—not because vertical lacks moats, but because it's growing at 8% while security/data infra hit 21-22%. Markets are pricing "can you grow when AI makes customers more efficient, not more numerous?"
→ **Relevant weil:** Position AI consulting around GROWTH acceleration, not just efficiency—that's what investors actually value now.

## 2️⃣-4️⃣ WORTH KNOWING:
- **First-time fund lessons**: New VCs are too eager to deploy early to prove themselves—the best investors deploy slowly, fight for every dollar in winners, and trust conviction over FOMO.
- **OpenAI's crisis is real**: Burning $9B/year, may run out of cash by mid-2027, forced into ads model while Anthropic takes enterprise (40% market share) and breaks even by 2028—consumer mindshare ≠ sustainable business.
- **StrongDM's "Dark Factory"**: Team building production software where NO human reviews code—agents write it, digital twins of Okta/Slack/Jira test it, spending $1K/day per engineer on tokens—this is software development's near future.

## 5️⃣ CONTENT ANGLE:
Write "Why German SMEs Will Win the AI Race" — hyperscalers spend $500B+ on infrastructure while vertical software crashes because it can't prove AI drives growth. German Mittelstand has domain depth + real customer data = perfect AI moat if positioned as growth driver, not cost cutter. Data point: Google's AI customers grew 52x YoY but only those proving ROI survive.
