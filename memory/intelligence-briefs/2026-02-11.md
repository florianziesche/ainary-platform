## 🔥 MUST-KNOW
**Meta adds "Product Sense with AI" interview** — First major PM interview change in 5 years. Candidates work through product problems with AI in real-time, evaluated on how they notice when models guess, ask follow-ups, and decide despite uncertainty. This is the new baseline skill for PM roles. *Source: Lenny's Newsletter*

## 📊 WORTH-KNOWING

**Voice AI funding wave: $500M+ in January** — ElevenLabs ($500M/$11B), Decagon ($250M), Deepgram ($130M), Gradium ($70M seed). Customer support dominates use cases. Early VCs backing vertical voice startups in regulated markets. OpenAI voice features lagging, expected Q1. *Source: Newcomer*

**Opus 4.6 vs Codex 5.3: Post-benchmark era** — Both dropped Feb 5. Codex feels "more Claude-like" (better git, faster feedback), but Opus still wins on usability and broad task handling. Benchmarks no longer signal real-world capability — user feedback and vibe are now the signal. Industry entering "horizontal agent supervision" phase. *Source: Interconnects*

**SaaS apocalypse: $285B wiped, software at 10-year P/E lows** — Markets repricing terminal value, not current earnings. Claude Cowork + agent plugins triggered "AI will replace SaaS" narrative. Hedge funds shorting $24B in software. Meanwhile: xAI raised $20B, Meta-Corning $6B fiber deal, Nvidia/Lilly $1B pharma AI lab. China's Zhipu/MiniMax IPOs 1,100x oversubscribed. *Source: State of AI February*

**AI doesn't reduce work — it intensifies it** — Berkeley Haas study (200 employees, April-Dec 2025): LLMs create "parallel work threads" — code generation while writing manually, multiple agents running, background tasks piling up. Workers report momentum + exhaustion. Mental energy depleted after 1-2 hours despite high output. Organizations need "AI practice" structures to avoid burnout. *Source: Simon Willison*

## ✍️ CONTENT ANGLE
**"The AI Productivity Paradox: Why I'm More Burned Out Than Ever"** — Personal essay on the hidden cost of AI leverage. Angle: You're 3x more productive but somehow working harder than before. The "just one more prompt" addiction. How to build sustainable AI workflows before you hit the wall. Resonates with operators feeling the intensity + relevant for VC interviews (show you understand real adoption patterns).
