## 🔥 MUST-KNOW

**Professional "vibe coding" is now a real job.** Lovable hired someone with zero coding background to build production software purely using AI. The key insight: design taste and knowing WHAT to build > coding skills. Planning and chat mode > prompting.

**Source:** Lenny's Newsletter - "Getting paid to vibe code: Inside the new AI-era job"  
**Relevance:** Direct implications for AI operator positioning + VC thesis on AI-native talent

## 📊 WORTH-KNOWING

### 1. First-Time VC Fund Manager Lessons

**Key insights:**
- Deploy slow (24+ months is fine, 2x normal pace is acceptable)
- Fight for every dollar in breakouts — $10K extra can make huge difference for small funds
- Don't assume you know your access level (can get into Tier 1 rounds with right pitch)
- Top performers take ~6 years to settle into terminal quartile
- First investor in earns special trust level
- Be skeptical of your early investment urges (probably too eager to validate existence to LPs)

**Source:** The Generalist - "Lessons of a First-Time Fund Manager"  
**Relevance:** Directly applicable to Ainary Ventures fund strategy + positioning for VC associate roles

### 2. The Dark Factory Has Arrived

**StrongDM's AI team built a "software factory" where:**
- Code is NOT written by humans
- Code is NOT reviewed by humans
- Rule: "If you haven't spent at least $1,000 on tokens today per human engineer, your factory has room for improvement"
- They clone entire SaaS products (Okta, Slack, Jira, Google Drive) as "Digital Twin Universe" for testing
- Use "holdout scenarios" (like ML test sets) to validate agent-built code
- Released "Attractor" coding agent as pure markdown specs (no code in repo)

**Catalyst:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Oct 2024) when agentic coding began to "compound correctness rather than error"

**Source:** Simon Willison - "How StrongDM's AI team build serious software without even looking at the code"  
**Relevance:** Cutting-edge AI engineering practices; potential consulting angle for German SMEs on AI adoption

### 3. Markets Price AI Risk via Growth, Not Disruption

**The data:**
- Vertical software down 43% YTD
- DevTools down only 21%
- Gap = 22 percentage points
- Correlation between forward growth and revenue multiple: 0.51

**The insight:** Markets don't fear AI will replace software categories. They fear slow growth. Fast-growing infrastructure (22%) and security (21%) hold strong because AI adoption creates MORE work (more code to manage, more queries, more surface area to protect).

**Winner proof point:** Atlassian Intelligence hit 5M MAU, cloud revenue +26% to $1B, RPO +44% YoY.

**Source:** Tomasz Tunguz - "How Markets Price AI Risk"  
**Relevance:** VC investment thesis validation; market timing for fund deployment

## 💡 CONTENT ANGLE

**Title:** "You Spent Your Whole Life Getting Good at the Wrong Thing"

**Core thesis:** The shift from "how to do it" to "what to do" is the biggest career inflection since the internet. Execution is collapsing; judgment, taste, agency are load-bearing.

**5 skills that became critical overnight when AI made execution cheap:**
1. **Taste** — Selection among infinite options (recognizing quality)
2. **Judgment** — Evaluation under uncertainty (weighing trade-offs)
3. **Agency** — Initiation (deciding to act, asking the wish)
4. **Curiosity** — Seed skill (if you're not curious, forget the rest)
5. **Management** — Coordinating swarms of agents (different from doing one thing yourself)

**The genie lamp mental model:** AI is the closest thing to a genie. The "how" is outsourced. Mental effort must shift fully to "what do you want?"

**Why it feels hard:**
- Self-image problem: "I'm productive" meant "I execute well" — now execution is commodity
- Vocabulary problem: Our language for value is built around doing, not deciding
- Avoidance: People use AI for safe, small things (email templates) to avoid confronting that their core skills are automatable

**Relevance:** Massive LinkedIn/Twitter thread potential; speaks directly to AI-native operator positioning; differentiates Florian from traditional VC candidates
