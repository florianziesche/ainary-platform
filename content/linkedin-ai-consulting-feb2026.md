## Post 1: "The AI Implementation Gap"

**Hook:** Most AI projects fail. Here's why.

**Body:**
I've spent the last 5 years building AI systems — from raising €5.5M for a Computer Vision SaaS to building multi-agent systems with <0.2% error rates.

The pattern is clear: **Most AI projects fail not because of the technology, but because of implementation.**

Here's what actually kills AI projects in mid-market companies:

1. **No clear use case** — "Let's do AI" is not a strategy
2. **Over-engineering** — Trying to boil the ocean instead of solving ONE problem
3. **Data chaos** — You can't AI your way out of bad data governance
4. **No internal champion** — If no one owns it, it dies after the consultant leaves
5. **Wrong expectations** — AI is not magic, it's math

What works:
✅ Start with a painful, specific problem
✅ Build a working prototype in 4-8 weeks
✅ Measure before/after (time saved, errors reduced, revenue impact)
✅ Iterate based on actual usage
✅ Transfer knowledge to internal teams

Example: I built a CNC production planning system for a German manufacturer. Result: 92% time savings, €22,900/year cost reduction. Timeline: 6 weeks.

The companies winning with AI aren't the ones with the biggest budgets. They're the ones with clear problems and a bias toward shipping.

What's your experience? Where have you seen AI projects succeed or fail?

## Post 2: "€15,000 for a €30,000 AI Project"

**Hook:** Most German Mittelstand companies don't know they can get 50% funding for AI projects.

**Body:**
Bavaria's Digitalbonus Plus program offers up to €30,000 in funding (50% co-financing) for AI and digitalization projects.

The catch? Almost no one knows about it.

I've been researching German funding programs for AI implementation. Here's what I found:

**Bayern Digitalbonus Plus:**
- Up to €30,000 funding
- 50% co-financing (you pay €15K, state pays €15K)
- No consultant authorization required (unlike the old go-digital program)
- Covers: AI consulting, software, implementation, training

**Who qualifies:**
- KMU with <500 employees
- <€50M annual revenue
- Based in Bavaria

**What's funded:**
✅ AI consulting projects
✅ Software implementation
✅ Internal training
✅ Prototype development

**Example:**
A €30,000 AI project (discovery workshop + prototype + implementation) costs your company €15,000 after funding.

**Similar programs exist in:**
- Sachsen: EFRE Digitalisierung (50-60% funding)
- Federal: Digital Jetzt (up to €100K)

The irony: While everyone talks about "democratizing AI," funding programs that actually democratize access are sitting unused.

If you're a German manufacturer, logistics company, or professional services firm exploring AI — check if you qualify. It might cut your project cost in half.

Have you used these programs? What was your experience?

## Post 3: "Why I'm Building in Public (Again)"

**Hook:** Five years ago, I raised €5.5M for a Computer Vision startup. Today, I'm starting from scratch. Here's why I'm documenting the journey.

**Body:**
In 2019, I was CEO of a Computer Vision SaaS. We raised €5.5M, built a team, served enterprise customers.

By 2024, I'd learned more from what went wrong than what went right.

Now I'm rebuilding — but differently:

**Then:**
- Raised big, hired fast
- Sold to everyone, focused on no one
- Built features, not products
- Optimized for vanity metrics

**Now:**
- Bootstrapping + consulting revenue
- Vertical-specific (Manufacturing, Legal, Municipal)
- Ship fast, iterate with real users
- Optimize for customer outcomes

**Why build in public?**

1. **Accountability** — Can't hide from reality when you're documenting it
2. **Compounding** — Every project, every insight, every mistake becomes content
3. **Network effects** — Sharing attracts better customers, partners, collaborators
4. **Learning in public = 10x learning** — Writing forces clarity

**What I'm sharing:**
- Real revenue numbers (currently €3K/month, target €500K this year)
- AI implementation case studies
- Funding research (Digitalbonus, EFRE, etc.)
- Product development (CNC Planner SaaS, Legal AI)
- VC transition journey (from CEO → Associate)

Some people think "stealth mode" protects competitive advantage. I think speed of execution beats stealth every time.

Your idea is worth nothing. Your execution is worth everything.

Follow along if you're interested in:
- AI for manufacturing/legal/municipal sectors
- Founder-to-VC transitions
- Practical AI implementation (not hype)

Let's build.

## Post 4: "The Vertical AI Thesis"

**Hook:** Horizontal AI platforms are crowded. Vertical AI is wide open.

**Body:**
Everyone's building the next "ChatGPT for X."

The real opportunity is deeper: **Vertical AI that owns the workflow.**

Here's the difference:

**Horizontal AI:**
- Generic models for generic tasks
- "AI writing assistant" "AI code helper"
- Lots of users, low retention
- Competes on features
- Example: Jasper, Copy.ai

**Vertical AI:**
- Domain-specific models + workflows
- Owns the entire process, not just one step
- Smaller TAM, but 10x retention
- Competes on outcomes
- Example: Harvey (legal), Glean (enterprise search), Convergent (CNC manufacturing)

**Why vertical AI wins:**

1. **Data moat** — Industry-specific data is hard to replicate
2. **Workflow lock-in** — When you own the process, users can't leave
3. **Pricing power** — ROI-based pricing vs seat-based
4. **Defensibility** — Domain expertise + data > model size

**My bet:** The next wave of AI unicorns will be vertical-first.

I'm building in three verticals:
- **Manufacturing** — CNC production planning (92% time savings proven)
- **Legal** — Multi-agent RAG with <0.2% hallucination rate
- **Municipal** — AI for German local government (OZG compliance)

Each has:
✅ Clear ROI (time saved, errors reduced, revenue impact)
✅ High switching costs (workflow integration)
✅ Regulatory moats (compliance = barrier to entry)

The companies that win won't be the ones with the best AI. They'll be the ones that understand an industry so deeply that AI is just the leverage layer.

What vertical do you think is ripe for AI disruption?

## Post 5: "From Founder to VC: Why I'm Making the Transition"

**Hook:** After 5 years as a startup CEO, I'm transitioning into venture capital. Here's why.

**Body:**
I spent 5 years as CEO of a Computer Vision startup. Raised €5.5M. Built a team. Shipped product. Made mistakes. Learned lessons.

Now I'm transitioning into VC. Here's the thinking:

**What I learned as a founder:**
- Technical depth matters (can you spot BS in a pitch?)
- Operator empathy matters (have you been in the trenches?)
- Pattern recognition matters (have you seen this movie before?)

**Why VC:**
1. **Leverage** — Help 20 founders instead of being 1 founder
2. **Learning** — See 1,000 companies/year vs building 1
3. **Network effects** — Connect founders, share lessons, build ecosystem
4. **Capital allocation** — Get better at spotting what works

**What I bring:**
- Technical credibility (can evaluate AI/ML pitches)
- Fundraising experience (know what investors want)
- Operator scar tissue (know what kills startups)
- European bridge (can source EU founders scaling to US)

**What I'm looking for:**
- Seed/Series A funds in NYC
- AI-focused or deep-tech thesis
- Operator-friendly culture
- Values technical depth

**What I'm NOT doing:**
- Abandoning building (still shipping CNC Planner, Legal AI, consulting)
- Going full-time VC immediately (building revenue first)
- Forgetting where I came from (founders first, always)

If you're a VC fund hiring or know someone who is — let's talk.

If you're a founder who made this transition — what advice do you have?
