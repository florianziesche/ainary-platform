## Post 1: The AI-Native Workflow

**Hook:** Most people use AI wrong.

---

Most people use AI as a search engine with extra steps.

Ask question → Get answer → Forget.

That's not AI-native. That's AI-tourist.

Here's what changed when I built a **compound AI system:**

**Before:**
- Context lost every conversation
- Same questions asked repeatedly  
- Knowledge scattered across 10 apps
- AI felt like a party trick

**After:**
- AI remembers everything I've taught it
- Every interaction makes it smarter
- One system that connects all my tools
- AI is a genuine leverage multiplier

The difference? **Feedback loops.**

When your AI system captures → connects → compounds → improves, you get exponential returns.

Most people are linear. The opportunity is exponential.

---

**What I built:**
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Specialized agents for different tasks
- Automated briefings and follow-ups
- Knowledge base that grows daily

It took me 5 years of building AI products to realize:

The edge isn't using AI.
It's building **systems** that use AI.

## Post 2: From Founder to Investor (The Hard Part)

**Hook:** Nobody tells you this about career transitions.

---

I spent 5 years as a startup CEO.

Raised $5M+. Sold to BMW, Siemens, Bosch. Built a team of 15+.

Now I'm transitioning to venture capital.

And honestly? It's harder than I expected.

Here's what nobody tells you:

**1. Your network was built for a different game**

As a founder, you know other founders.
As an investor, you need to know investors.
The Venn diagram overlap is smaller than you think.

**2. The market doesn't know how to read you**

You're not a traditional finance person.
You're not a "career investor."
You're something else — and recruiters don't have a box for that.

**3. Your skills are valuable, but hard to articulate**

"I can evaluate whether this AI architecture will scale."
"I know what founder burnout looks like at month 18."
"I've made the mistakes they're about to make."

These matter. But they don't fit on a standard resume.

**4. Identity is real**

Founder → Employee is a psychological shift.
You're not running the show anymore.
That takes adjustment.

The good part?

Everything I learned building a company — pattern recognition, urgency, empathy for founders — transfers.

I just have to find the funds that value operators.

They exist. (Shoutout to the ones explicitly seeking founder experience.)

If you've made a similar transition, I'd love to hear:

**Notes:**
- Vulnerable but not weak
- Positions you as thoughtful
- Invites engagement
- Shows self-awareness
