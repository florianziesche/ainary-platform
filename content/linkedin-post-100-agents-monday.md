# LinkedIn Post: 100 AI Agents Teaser

I just shipped 100 AI agent experiments.

Not in production.  
Not in a startup.  
Just me, OpenClaw, and a weekend.

Here's what I learned:

→ Most "AI agents" are just fancy APIs with retry logic  
→ The ones that actually work are boring (copy files, summarize PDFs, send emails)  
→ The ones that sound impressive mostly fail  
→ Building 100 bad agents teaches you more than reading 100 blog posts

The pattern I keep seeing:

Simple task + clear success criteria = works  
Complex task + vague goal = infinite loop

I wrote up the full breakdown on Substack.  
Which agents worked, which didn't, and why most people are building the wrong thing.

Link in comments.

What's the dumbest AI agent you've built that actually worked?

**Alternative Version (wenn du mehr Kontext geben willst):**

100 AI agents in one weekend.

That was the experiment.

Not building a product. Not raising money. Just testing what actually works when you strip away the hype.

The results surprised me:

→ The "impressive" agents (market research, competitive analysis) mostly hallucinated  
→ The boring ones (file organizers, email drafters) shipped value immediately  
→ Multi-agent orchestration is 90% debugging race conditions  
→ Your first 50 agents will be trash. That's the cost of learning.

I documented everything in a Substack post.  
What worked, what failed, what I'd do differently.

Link in comments.

Have you built agents that actually ship? What broke?

**Notizen:**

- Beide Versionen sind LLM-Tell-frei (keine em-dashes, kein "genuinely", kein "It's worth noting")
- Kurze Sätze, eigene Zeilen
- Pfeile statt Bullet Points
- Frage am Ende (engagement hook)
- Persönlich aber nicht weich
- Keine Buzzwords ("revolutionize", "game-changer", etc.)
- Link in comments (LinkedIn-Best-Practice, sonst wird Reichweite reduziert)

**Wahl:** Ich würde **Version 1** empfehlen - kürzer, punchier, mehr Florian-Style.

**Nächste Schritte:**
1. Post Montag morgen 08:00-10:00 CET auf LinkedIn posten
2. Link zum Substack Artikel im ersten Comment posten (nicht im Post selbst)
3. Auf Kommentare reagieren
