# LinkedIn Post — Sequoia AGI

Sequoia Capital just declared: "This is AGI."

As someone who ships AI to BMW, Siemens, and Bosch — they got the milestone right, but named the wrong finish line.

The data is real: AI task horizons doubling every 7 months. Claude solves 50% of tasks that take humans 5 hours. These systems can chain reasoning, use tools, and persist through multi-hour assignments.

But here's what builders notice that VCs miss:

Current AI processes snapshots. It receives context, generates output, waits for the next prompt.

It doesn't maintain a world model. It doesn't anticipate what's about to happen. It doesn't update its understanding in real-time as conditions change.

On a manufacturing floor, this gap is obvious. The model processes Frame 1, returns a verdict, processes Frame 2. It never builds a model of "the line is running differently today." The operators know. The AI doesn't.

Sequoia's right about the milestone. But calling it AGI obscures the most important frontier:

Persistent world models — AI that doesn't just process snapshots of reality, but genuinely inhabits time.

The gold is in the cracks between what we've built and what we're building next.
