# Twitter Thread — Sequoia AGI

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Sequoia just declared AGI has arrived.

As someone who ships AI to factories daily, they got the milestone right — but named the wrong finish line.

Here's what builders see that VCs miss 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Data):**
The data IS impressive:
• AI task horizons doubling every 7 months
• Claude solves 50% of 5-hour human tasks
• Systems chain reasoning across multi-hour assignments

Sequoia isn't wrong about the milestone.

**Tweet 3 (The Gap):**
But current AI — even the most sophisticated agents — processes snapshots.

Receive context → process → respond → wait.

It doesn't maintain a world model. It doesn't anticipate. It reacts to what happened, not what's about to happen.

**Tweet 4 (Real Example):**
On a manufacturing floor, this is obvious.

The model processes Frame 1, returns a verdict, processes Frame 2. Each judgment is isolated.

It never builds a model of "the line is running hot today."

The operators know. The AI doesn't.

**Tweet 5 (The Nuance):**
For knowledge work — code, research, writing — batch processing IS often enough.

Sequoia's right about THAT.

But they didn't say "Knowledge Work AGI."
They said "AGI."

General intelligence requires persistent world models.

**Tweet 6 (The Frontier):**
The next breakthrough isn't bigger context windows or deeper reasoning on static problems.

It's AI that doesn't just process snapshots of reality — but genuinely inhabits time.

Persistent, predictive, continuously aware.

**Tweet 7 (Kintsugi Close):**
The gap isn't a flaw. It's the seam that shows us what comes next.

The gold is in the cracks.
