## Note 1: Quick Insight

The most underrated AI skill isn't prompting.

It's defining what "done" looks like before the AI starts.

Vague input → vague output. Every time.

The founders who get 10x leverage from AI aren't better at writing prompts. They're better at thinking clearly about what they actually need.

## Note 2: Behind the Scenes

Real number from my AI agent setup this week:

50 deliverables prepared overnight.
2 actually sent to a human.

The bottleneck is never the AI.
It's always the founder pressing send.

Building systems is easy. Shipping is hard. That hasn't changed.

## Note 3: Industry Observation

By 2036, up to 20 million German workers will retire. Most of their expertise isn't documented.

In CNC manufacturing, one experienced Meister holds decades of knowledge about machine settings, material quirks, and edge cases — all in their head.

AI can't replace that person. But it can capture and structure their knowledge before they leave.

This is the most underrated AI use case: not replacing humans, but making sure their expertise survives them.
