Yann LeCun — who literally invented the neural networks these models run on — says we're nowhere close.</span>

I think the answer is hiding in something neither of them talks about: time.

Not compute time. Not inference time. Lived time.

Researchers call it the "Temporal Blindness Problem" — current AI cannot represent, track, or reason within temporal experience. It simulates time statistically. It has no sense of before and after. No autobiographical memory. No felt duration.

A 4-year-old knows that you boil water before you pour it. Not because someone labeled the training data. Because she experienced the sequence. She burned her hand once. She remembers.

LLMs process tokens. They don't experience sequences. They're completing patterns in a timeless void.

Sequoia's METR data shows agents solving longer tasks every 7 months. But "longer" isn't the same as "through time." An agent that runs for 5 hours is still experiencing each moment as the first.

LeCun left Meta to build world models with persistent memory and causal reasoning. That's the right direction. But even he hasn't named the deepest gap:

Intelligence isn't just modeling the world. It's modeling the world <span class="punch">as it changes while you're thinking about it.</span>

Yann LeCun — who literally invented the neural networks these models run on — says we're nowhere close.</span>

In physics, there's a concept called a phase transition. Water doesn't get "more water" before it becomes ice. It fundamentally changes state.

That's what the AGI debate misses.

Sequoia sees agents solving longer tasks every 7 months and draws a straight line to the future. But METR benchmarks measure performance within the current phase — pattern matching on static context windows.

LeCun sees the same data and says: you can't get to human intelligence by scaling this architecture. He left Meta to build world models — systems that predict consequences before acting, that maintain persistent memory, that understand cause and effect.

He's betting on a phase transition. Sequoia is betting on a steeper curve.

The history of science says LeCun is right. We didn't get from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics by making Newton's equations more precise. We needed a fundamentally different framework.

76% of AI researchers now say scaling alone won't deliver AGI. The problems are architectural, not quantitative.

We're heating the water and measuring the temperature. But we're not even close to the boiling point.

Here's an image that might help you decide who's right:

Imagine a surgeon who closes her eyes between every cut. She reads the chart. Plans the incision. Cuts. Then closes her eyes, forgets what she saw, and reads the chart again.

That's how every AI agent works today.

Read context window. Reason. Act. Forget. Repeat.

No continuous perception. No streaming input. No persistent world model that updates as the environment changes.

Sequoia's METR benchmarks show agents handling longer tasks every 7 months. But the length of the surgery isn't the problem. It's the blindness between the cuts.

LeCun understood this. He left Meta and founded AMI Labs to build systems with persistent memory and causal reasoning. As he put it at Davos:
<span class="quote">"We're never going to get to human-level intelligence by training on text only. We need the real world."</span>
The real world doesn't pause while you process it.

Intelligence isn't how long you can operate. It's whether you ever open your eyes.

<!-- V4: ENTROPY / COMPRESSION -->

  </div>
  <div class="post-content"><span class="hook">Sequoia says AGI is here.

Yann LeCun — who literally invented the neural networks these models run on — says we're nowhere close.</span>

There's a paper making rounds in research circles: "The Thermodynamics of Intelligence." Its core claim is radical and simple:

Intelligence is a function of efficient compression.

Not scale. Not parameter count. Not benchmark scores. The ability to compress reality into a model that predicts what happens next — with minimum energy, maximum accuracy.

By that definition, a human toddler is more intelligent than GPT-5.2. She builds a world model from a few hundred experiences. GPT-5.2 needs 13 trillion tokens and still can't predict that a ball rolls downhill.

This is what LeCun has been saying. He left Meta because they chose brute force over elegant compression. He's building world models at AMI Labs — systems that understand physics, not statistics.

Sequoia measures intelligence in task-hours. Thermodynamics measures it in bits per prediction.

We're spending $135 billion on bigger furnaces when the breakthrough is a better engine.

<span class="punch">Nature doesn't scale. It compresses. Maybe intelligence does too.</span></div>

  <div class="post-content"><span class="hook">Sequoia says AGI is here.

Yann LeCun — who literally invented the neural networks these models run on — says we're nowhere close.</span>

The data suggests a third possibility: we're not approaching AGI. We're approaching a wall.

OpenAI just retired 6 models in one week — including GPT-4o and GPT-5. Not because GPT-5.2 is radically better. Because the improvements are marginal. The model card quietly reveals what insiders suspected: diminishing returns on scaling.

Meanwhile, human training data is running out. Meta plans to spend $135 billion in 2026 largely on generating synthetic data — AI training on AI output. A snake eating its own tail.

LeCun saw this wall from inside Meta and walked away. His argument at Davos was clean:
<span class="quote">"The AI industry is completely LLM-pilled. In Silicon Valley, everybody is working on the same thing. They're all digging the same trench."</span>
Sequoia's exponential METR curve looks like progress. But exponential curves within a bounded paradigm are just the leading edge of an S-curve.

Every technology hits its ceiling. Vacuum tubes got faster too — right up until the transistor made them irrelevant.

<span class="punch">The question isn't how fast we're climbing. It's whether we're on the right wall.</span></div>

Yann LeCun — who literally invented the neural networks these models run on — says we're nowhere close.</span>

Here's a question neither of them asks:

Can it dream?

Not metaphorically. Neuroscience shows that dreaming isn't idle noise — it's where the brain reorganizes experience, tests hypotheses against memory, and integrates new patterns into its world model. REM sleep is offline training on lived experience.

Every biological intelligence on Earth — from dogs to dolphins to humans — dreams.

No AI system does. Because dreaming requires something current architectures fundamentally lack: a continuous stream of experience worth reorganizing.

An LLM has no experiences to dream about. It processes tokens. It doesn't live through anything.

LeCun's new startup AMI Labs is building toward this — persistent memory, world models, causal reasoning. Systems that accumulate experience over time.

But Sequoia's METR benchmarks measure something different entirely. They measure task completion. Not learning. Not integration. Not the slow accumulation of understanding that happens between the tasks.

Intelligence isn't what you do when you're working.
