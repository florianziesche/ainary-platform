# 48 Hours with an AI Co-Pilot: What We Built

*February 6–7, 2026 — Florian Ziesche × Mia (AI Agent)*

## The Setup

One person. One AI agent. 48 hours. No team. No contractors. No templates.

The AI runs 24/7 — researching, drafting, building, organizing — while the human directs strategy, makes decisions, and reviews output. Everything below was produced in two days.

## How It Works

The human provides direction, makes strategic decisions, and reviews output. The AI:

- **Researches** — web search, source synthesis, competitive analysis
- **Writes** — articles, emails, pitches, cover letters in calibrated voice
- **Builds** — websites, PDFs, dashboards, documentation
- **Challenges itself** — deploys adversarial "red team" agents to find weaknesses in its own work
- **Organizes** — syncs files, maintains memory, prepares briefings
- **Works in parallel** — multiple specialized agents tackle different aspects simultaneously

The key insight: **the AI doesn't replace the human's judgment. It amplifies their capacity.** Strategy stays human. Execution scales through AI.

## The Process That Emerged

After 48 hours of iteration, a validated workflow crystallized:

1. **Fast first draft** — capture the initial direction quickly
2. **Multi-perspective research** — 3 parallel agents with different lenses (strategy, positioning, adversarial)
3. **Human synthesis** — the primary agent integrates all perspectives (sub-agents produce raw material, the orchestrator connects dots)
4. **Explicit comparison** — v1 vs v2 table makes improvement visible and traceable

This isn't automation. It's a new way of working.
