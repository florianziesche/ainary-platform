### Fixes Applied

| # | Severity | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|-------|-----|
| B1 | 🔴 BLOCKER | Sascha Fast quote cited as [6] (COG/DEV.to) — should be [17] (Zettelkasten.de) | Changed [6]→[17] in Section 6 body text and Claim Register #7 source ([6][10]→[17][10]) |
| S1 | 🟡 SHOULD-FIX | Exhibit source lines used Source Log numbering ([S7], [S8], etc.) | Standardized all [S*] refs to report reference numbers [N] across Exhibits 1–3, KPIs, Transparency Note |
| S2 | 🟡 SHOULD-FIX | Claim Register header said "Badge" | Changed to "Type" per TEMPLATE-RULES |
| S3 | 🟡 SHOULD-FIX | Section 11: absence-of-evidence claims marked [E] | Reclassified to [I] — the key insight and all 4 gap bullets (inference from literature review, not direct evidence) |

### Not Applied
| # | Severity | Issue | Reason |
|---|----------|-------|--------|
| S4 | 🟡 | Title slightly overpromises | Low priority; subtitle compensates. Per task rules: no new content. |
| N1 | 🟢 | Token count precision | Defensible as-is; would add new content. |
| N2 | 🟢 | Quote attribution nuance | Minor; would add new content. |

**Status:** All blockers resolved. Report ready for release.
