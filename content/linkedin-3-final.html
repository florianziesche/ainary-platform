Yann LeCun — who invented the neural networks these models run on — says we're nowhere close.

One of them is fundamentally wrong.

Here's what nobody talks about: every AI agent operates on snapshots. Read. Reason. Act. Forget. Repeat.

Your brain updates its model of reality 40 times per second. The best AI does it once per prompt.

That's not a gap you close with scale. That's an architecture problem.

LeCun saw this from inside Meta and left. He's now building world models — systems that perceive continuously, remember persistently, and predict consequences before acting.

Sequoia's benchmarks show agents improving fast. But they're measuring speed within the wrong paradigm.

<strong>The next breakthrough won't come from scale. It'll come from architecture. That's the bet that matters.</strong>

    Your brain: 40 updates/second. GPT: 1 update/prompt. Quantified gap that's visceral and memorable.

  <div class="post">Sequoia says AGI is here.

Yann LeCun — who invented the neural networks these models run on — says we're nowhere close.

One of them is fundamentally wrong.

In physics, there's a concept called phase transition. Water doesn't get "more watery" before it becomes ice. It changes state.

Current AI can't do that. Every agent reads a context window, acts, then forgets. No continuity. No real-time world model. Just increasingly fast pattern matching.

LeCun left Meta to build what's actually missing — systems that perceive continuously, hold persistent memory, and predict consequences before acting. A different phase entirely.

Sequoia measures speed. LeCun is building sight.

    Phase transition framing: You can't scale your way to a new state of matter. Physics-native thinking.

Yann LeCun — who invented the neural networks these models run on — says we're nowhere close.

One of them is fundamentally wrong.

Here's a fact that should bother you: a fruit fly has more temporal awareness than GPT-5.2. It continuously updates its understanding of reality. It predicts where the swatter is going, not where it was.

Every AI agent today works on snapshots. Read. Act. Forget. Repeat. No continuity. No streaming perception. No sense of time passing.

LeCun saw this and left Meta. He's building world models — systems with persistent memory and causal reasoning. Not bigger language models. A different architecture entirely.

Sequoia's benchmarks show agents getting faster. But speed without perception is just faster blindness.
