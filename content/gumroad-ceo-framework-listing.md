## Description

### What You Get

This is the exact Notion system I built and refined over 5 years running a venture-backed AI startup.

Not theory. Not templates I made for you. **The actual operating system I used to:**

- Scale from 0 to $1M+ in contract value
- Manage a team of 15+ people
- Close Fortune 500 customers (BMW, Siemens, Bosch)
- Raise $5M+ in venture capital

### What's Inside

**📋 Task Management System**
- Kanban board with smart views
- Priority matrix (urgent vs. important)
- Weekly sprint planning workflow
- Daily focus dashboard

**👥 People Database**
- CRM for founders, investors, customers, team
- Relationship tracking
- Meeting notes integration
- Follow-up automation prompts

**📈 Pipeline Tracking**
- Leads → Qualified → Proposal → Closed
- Stage-based automation
- Win/loss analysis
- Revenue forecasting views

**📅 Planning System**
- Quarterly OKRs
- Weekly sprint cycles
- Daily planning template
- Review workflows (weekly, monthly, quarterly)

**📚 SOPs & Documentation**
- 9 battle-tested standard operating procedures
- Lead qualification
- Client onboarding
- Proposal creation
- Contract management
- And more...

**🎯 Templates**
- Meeting notes
- Weekly sprint plan
- Client page
- Lead page
- Daily plan

### Why This Works

Most Notion templates are designed by people who think about productivity.

This one was designed by someone who **needed** productivity — while building a company, raising money, and managing a team.

Every view, every automation, every workflow exists because I needed it to survive.

### Who This Is For

✅ Founders running startups  
✅ Solo consultants managing clients  
✅ Agency owners tracking projects  
✅ Anyone who needs a proven operating system

### Who This Is NOT For

❌ People who want a pretty template with no substance  
❌ Anyone looking for a quick fix (systems require commitment)  
❌ Folks who won't customize it to their needs
