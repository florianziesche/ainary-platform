## 📏 Optimal Length

| Type | Length | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Text posts** | 800-1300 chars | Sweet spot for engagement |
| **With image** | 500-1000 chars | Image does some heavy lifting |
| **Carousels** | 8-15 slides | >20 slides = 30% reach drop |
| **Video** | 30-90 seconds | Native uploads only |

**Rule:** Shorter > Longer. Every sentence must earn its place.

## 🎣 Hook (First 2 Lines = EVERYTHING)

The hook appears BEFORE "see more" — this is your headline.

### Hook Formulas That Work:

1. **Curiosity gap:**
   > "What if I told you [surprising claim]?"

2. **Insider knowledge:**
   > "Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]..."

3. **Data-driven:**
   > "[Specific number] — that's [what it means]."

4. **Problem → Promise:**
   > "I struggled with [problem] until [solution hint]."

5. **Contrarian:**
   > "[Common belief] is wrong. Here's why."

6. **Agreement + Twist:**
   > "I agree with [authority]: [their point]. But they're missing [your insight]."

### Hook Rules:
- First line = pattern interrupt
- Second line = reason to click "see more"
- NO fluff, NO "Great post by..."
- Lead with tension or value

## 🏗️ Post Structure

```
[HOOK — 1-2 lines, curiosity/tension]

[CONTEXT — Why this matters, 1-2 sentences]

[INSIGHT/SOLUTION — The meat, structured with:]
  - Bullet points or numbered lists
  - Bold for key phrases
  - White space between ideas

[PROOF — Data, example, or personal result]

[TAKEAWAY — One clear sentence]

[CTA — Question or invitation to engage]
```

### Formatting Rules:
- **Short paragraphs** (1-3 sentences max)
- **Line breaks** between every idea
- **Bold** key phrases (not whole sentences)
- **No links in post body** (kills reach — put in comments)
- **No hashtags** or max 3 at the end

---

## 🗣️ Language & Tone

### DO:
- Write like you talk
- Use "you" and "I" (personal)
- Active voice, present tense
- Specific > vague ("15 hours/week" not "a lot of time")
- Confident but not arrogant

### DON'T:
- Corporate speak ("leverage synergies")
- Excessive "I" (make it about the reader/solution)
- Humble bragging
- Asking for engagement ("Like if you agree!")
- Generic advice without proof

---

## 📊 Engagement Triggers

1. **Dwell time** — #1 algorithm factor. Make them read slowly.
2. **Comments** — Reply to every comment in first hour
3. **Saves** — Actionable content gets saved
4. **Controversy** — Thoughtful disagreement > bland agreement

### First Hour is Critical:
- Be online to respond
- LinkedIn "tests" your post early
- Early engagement = wider distribution
