## Post 1: "My AI Agent Team"
*(Thema das Florian gewählt hat)*

I manage a team of 10 AI agents.

Each has a role: one finds leads, one writes emails, one creates content, one reviews code, one handles analysis.

They report to Mia, my AI COO. She delegates, tracks quality, flags what needs attention.

Last week they produced 50 deliverables overnight. Cost: $15.

What I learned managing AI agents is the same thing I learned managing people: unclear expectations produce bad results. Every time.

The skill isn't prompting. It's management.

I wrote a free playbook on exactly how this works — link in comments.

## Post 2: "The Send Button"

Last week I prepared 50 deliverables.
I sent 2.

AI made me 10x more productive at creating.
It made me 0x more productive at shipping.

The bottleneck was never the work. It was pressing send.

This is the thing nobody tells you about AI leverage: it exposes your real problems. And they're never technical.

## Post 3: "Manufacturing Knowledge" (CNC Angle)

By 2036, up to 20 million German workers will retire.

Most of their knowledge isn't documented. In CNC manufacturing, one experienced Meister holds decades of expertise in their head. Machine settings, material quirks, tolerance edge cases.

When they leave, the knowledge leaves with them.

I'm building software that captures this knowledge before it walks out the door. CNC work preparation that takes 10 minutes instead of 90.

Not because AI is smarter than the Meister. Because it never forgets, never retires, and works at 2 AM.

## Post 4: "The Real AI Skill"

The most underrated AI skill isn't prompting.

It's defining what "done" looks like before the AI starts.

"Write me an email" → garbage.
"Write a 5-sentence email to a CNC manufacturer in Saxony, referencing their Heidenhain machines, offering a 15-minute demo" → something I can actually send.

AI is a multiplier. But the quality still heavily depends on the human.

## Post 5: "Founder to VC" Update

3 weeks into my transition from founder to VC.

What surprised me most: the skills transfer more than I expected.

Pattern recognition from evaluating product-market fit at my own startup → evaluating it in others.
Technical due diligence → I can actually read the code and architecture.
Fundraising experience ($5M+ raised) → I understand both sides of the table.

What doesn't transfer: the network. Building that from zero in NYC. One conversation at a time.

If you're a founder considering VC, the operator background is an edge. Not everyone agrees. But the best investors I've met all built something first.
