# Post 07 — From Zero to First Customer

I'm building in public. Here's the raw, unfiltered version of going from nothing to first revenue.

Week 1: Had an idea. Talked to 12 potential customers. 9 said "interesting." 3 said "I'd pay for that." That's the only validation that matters -- willingness to pay.

Week 2: Built an MVP in 5 days using AI-assisted development. Not a landing page. A working prototype that solved one specific problem for one specific customer type.

Week 3: Sent the prototype to those 3 people. Got brutal feedback. Two features I thought were essential? Nobody cared. One thing I almost didn't build? They loved it.

Week 4: Rebuilt based on feedback. Stripped out the noise. Made the one valuable thing 10x better.

Week 5: First customer signed. Not a huge deal -- small contract, early-stage pricing. But real money from a real person solving a real problem.

What I'd do differently:

Talk to customers before writing a single line of code. I wasted 2 days building features based on assumptions.

Charge from day one. Free pilots create freeloaders, not customers. Even $50/month filters for seriousness.

Ship ugly. My first prototype looked terrible. The customer didn't care. They cared that it saved them 6 hours a week.

The total cost to get here: $0 in outside funding. About $200 in API costs. And roughly 120 hours of focused work.

You don't need a perfect product. You need a paying customer who tells you what perfect looks like.

What's stopping you from shipping your first version this week?
