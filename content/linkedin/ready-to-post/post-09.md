# Post 09 — I Used AI to Write 20 Sales Emails in 30 Minutes

And they outperformed my hand-written ones. Here's exactly how.

The old way: Research a prospect for 15 minutes. Write a personalized email for 10 minutes. Send. Repeat. At best, I'd do 8 emails in a focused morning. Response rate: about 12%.

The new way:

Step 1: I built a research agent that pulls a prospect's LinkedIn activity, company news, recent funding rounds, and tech stack. Takes 45 seconds per prospect.

Step 2: The agent feeds this research into a writing system with 6 email templates I've tested over 200+ sends. It picks the template that fits the prospect's situation and personalizes every line.

Step 3: I review each email in about 90 seconds. I'm checking tone, accuracy, and whether it sounds like something I'd actually say. I edit maybe 30% of them. The rest go out as-is.

Results after 3 months:
- 20 emails in 30 minutes (vs. 8 in 3 hours)
- Response rate: 18% (up from 12%)
- Booked meetings: 2-3x more per week
- Time saved: roughly 10 hours per week on outreach alone

Why the AI emails perform better: consistency. My hand-written emails varied wildly based on my energy level, mood, and how much coffee I'd had. The AI delivers the same quality at email #20 as email #1.

The key insight: AI didn't replace the strategy. I still decide who to email, what angle to take, and when to follow up. AI just eliminated the mechanical work of executing at volume.

What repetitive task in your workflow is begging to be automated?
