# Post 10 — What VCs Get Wrong About AI Startups

I've been on both sides of the table. Here's what most investors miss.

Mistake 1: Funding the model, not the system.

Most VCs still evaluate AI startups by asking "what model do you use?" Wrong question. The model is a commodity. GPT, Claude, Gemini -- they're all good enough. The moat is the system around the model: data pipelines, evaluation frameworks, domain expertise, and customer workflows.

Mistake 2: Confusing demo with product.

Every AI startup has a killer demo. It takes about 2 days to build one. The question isn't "does the demo work?" It's "does it work at 10,000 requests per day with messy real-world data from customers who don't read the instructions?" That's a 100x harder problem.

Mistake 3: Ignoring the last mile.

AI that works in a notebook is research. AI that works in a customer's existing workflow is a business. The integration, change management, and ongoing maintenance -- that's where 70% of the value lives. Most VCs underweight this completely.

Mistake 4: Overvaluing PhDs, undervaluing operators.

The best AI companies I've seen aren't led by researchers. They're led by operators who deeply understand a customer problem and use AI as a tool to solve it. Domain expertise compounds. Model expertise depreciates.

Mistake 5: Expecting SaaS margins on day one.

AI startups have real infrastructure costs. GPU compute, API calls, data processing. Margins improve with scale, but expecting 80% gross margins in year one kills promising companies.

If you're a founder pitching VCs: make them understand your system, not just your model.

What's the worst question you've gotten from an investor?
