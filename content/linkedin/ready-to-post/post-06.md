# Post 06 — Why Most AI Projects Fail

87% of AI projects never make it to production. I've seen why up close.

After building AI systems and evaluating dozens of AI startups, the pattern is painfully clear. It's almost never the technology that kills the project.

Here are the real reasons:

1. They solve a problem nobody has. Teams fall in love with what AI can do instead of asking what the business actually needs. I've seen companies spend $200K building an AI feature their customers never asked for and wouldn't pay for.

2. No data infrastructure. You can't build AI on messy data. Full stop. Most companies need 3-6 months of data cleanup before they can even start an AI project. Nobody wants to hear that, so they skip it. Then wonder why the model performs terribly.

3. Pilot purgatory. The proof of concept works. Everyone's excited. Then it sits in a sandbox for 14 months because nobody planned for integration, change management, or ongoing maintenance. The pilot becomes the product, and the product never ships.

4. Wrong success metrics. "We implemented AI" is not a metric. "We reduced customer response time by 40% and saved $180K annually" is a metric. Without clear ROI targets, projects drift.

5. Team mismatch. You need someone who understands both the technology AND the business problem. Pure technologists build impressive demos. Pure business people spec impossible requirements. You need the bridge.

What to do instead: Start with a $5K pilot on one specific workflow. Measure results in dollars or hours saved. Scale only what proves value.
