# Post 01 — Why I Left My CEO Role to Go Into VC

I walked away from a company I built from zero.

Not because it failed. Because I realized I was solving one problem when I could be solving dozens.

As CEO of 36ZERO Vision, I raised over $5M, built a team, shipped product, and got customers paying. The classic founder grind. I loved it.

But here's what nobody tells you about being a deep-tech CEO: you spend 80% of your time on things that have nothing to do with the technology. Fundraising. HR fires. Legal. Board management. Investor updates that take 3 days to write.

Meanwhile, I kept meeting founders building incredible AI companies who were making the same mistakes I made in year one. And I thought: what if I could sit on the other side of the table and actually help them skip those mistakes?

That's the real reason I'm moving into VC.

It's not about "picking winners." It's about compounding what I learned across 10, 20, 50 companies instead of just one.

The math is simple:
- As a founder, I mass one company at a time
- As an operator-turned-VC, I multiply my pattern recognition across an entire portfolio

I still build. I still ship AI systems every week. But now I'm also building the muscle to spot what works before the market does.

If you're a founder thinking about the jump to investing -- or an investor who's never operated -- I'd love to hear your perspective. What surprised you most about switching sides?
