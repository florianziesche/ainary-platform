# Post 04 — AI Agents Are the New Employees

I manage a team of AI agents the same way I used to manage people. Seriously.

Here's my current "org chart":

- Research Agent: Scans 200+ sources daily, surfaces what matters
- Content Agent: Drafts, edits, formats across platforms
- Outreach Agent: Personalizes emails, tracks responses, follows up
- Ops Agent: Manages my calendar, files, task tracking
- Analysis Agent: Runs numbers, builds reports, flags anomalies

Each has a defined role, clear KPIs, and boundaries on what they can and can't do autonomously.

Sound familiar? That's because it's management.

The biggest mistake people make with AI agents: treating them like magic. They're not. They're junior employees who are incredibly fast, never sleep, and need very clear instructions.

What I've learned managing AI agents for 6 months:

Onboarding matters. I spend 2-3 hours setting up each agent with the right context, tools, and guardrails. Skip this and you get garbage output.

Feedback loops are essential. When an agent produces bad work, I don't just fix it. I update the system so it doesn't happen again. Same as coaching a team member.

Autonomy is earned. New agents start with zero autonomy. Everything gets reviewed. As they prove reliable, I expand their decision space.

The result? I run operations that would normally require 3-4 people. Not because AI replaces people, but because it handles the repetitive 80% so I can focus on the strategic 20%.

What's one task you'd delegate to an AI agent today if you could?
