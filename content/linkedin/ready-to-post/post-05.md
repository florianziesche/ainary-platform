# Post 05 — The One-Person Company Is Real

I run a business that does the work of a small team. Here's my entire stack.

No employees. No office. No meetings that could've been an email -- because the AI writes the email.

My daily operating system:

Thinking and strategy: Claude (Anthropic). My primary AI. Handles research, analysis, writing, coding. I treat it like a chief of staff who happens to be available 24/7.

Knowledge management: Obsidian for private thinking, Notion for structured projects. Everything connects.

Automation: n8n workflows handle the repetitive stuff. Lead capture, email sequences, data syncing, report generation. Set up once, runs forever.

AI agents: Custom-built agents handle research, outreach, content distribution, and operations. They run in the background while I focus on high-leverage work.

Communication: Telegram for quick stuff, email for formal. AI drafts 90% of my emails -- I just review and send.

Content creation: AI assists with first drafts. I add the experience, opinions, and edge. 10x faster than writing from scratch.

The numbers:
- 4-6 hours of focused work per day
- Output equivalent to a 3-person team
- Total software cost: under $500/month
- Time saved per week: roughly 25 hours

This isn't about replacing human connection. I still have deep conversations, build relationships, and make judgment calls that require experience.

It's about eliminating everything that doesn't require a human brain.

The one-person company isn't a gimmick. It's the new default for anyone who learns to use these tools.

What tool in your stack saves you the most time?
