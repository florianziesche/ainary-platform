# Post 02 — The Excel Problem in Manufacturing

A $2.3 trillion industry still runs on spreadsheets. And nobody's talking about it.

I spent years in manufacturing tech. CNC machines, production planning, quality control. Here's what I saw over and over:

The shop floor has million-dollar machines controlled by software from 2005. The production manager tracks orders in Excel. The quality inspector writes results on paper, then types them into a different Excel sheet. End of month, someone spends 3 days reconciling everything.

This isn't a small shop problem. I've seen this at companies doing $50M+ in revenue.

Why? Three reasons:

1. ERP systems cost $500K+ and take 18 months to implement
2. Manufacturing people don't trust software that wasn't built by manufacturing people
3. Nobody has built the "vertical AI" that actually understands G-code, tolerances, and shop floor reality

The opportunity is massive. Here's what's changing:

AI can now read a technical drawing, extract tolerances, compare them against machine capabilities, and flag issues before a single chip is cut. In real time. For a fraction of what legacy software costs.

I've seen AI reduce quoting time from 4 hours to 12 minutes. Not by replacing the machinist's judgment -- by eliminating the data entry that buries it.

Manufacturing isn't boring. It's the biggest untapped AI market on the planet.

If you work in manufacturing and still fight Excel every day, I want to hear your worst spreadsheet horror story.
