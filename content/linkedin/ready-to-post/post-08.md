# Post 08 — The 3 AI Skills Every Founder Needs in 2026

You don't need to code. But if you can't do these three things, you're already behind.

Skill 1: Prompt architecture.

Not "prompt engineering." Architecture. Anyone can write a prompt. The skill is designing systems of prompts that chain together, handle edge cases, and produce reliable output at scale.

This means understanding context windows, retrieval-augmented generation, and how to structure information so AI gives you consistent results -- not just lucky ones.

Time to learn: 2 weeks of focused practice.

Skill 2: AI workflow design.

Knowing which parts of your business to automate with AI, and which to keep human. This requires understanding your own processes deeply enough to decompose them into steps, then deciding: does this step need judgment, or just execution?

The founders who win aren't using AI for everything. They're using it for the right things.

Time to learn: 1 month of experimentation.

Skill 3: AI evaluation.

How do you know if an AI output is good? Most people eyeball it. That works for one email. It doesn't work for 500 customer interactions per day.

You need to build evaluation frameworks: rubrics, test cases, edge case libraries, and automated quality checks. This is the difference between "we use AI" and "we use AI reliably."

Time to learn: Ongoing, but basics in 2 weeks.

Notice what's NOT on this list: coding, model training, or understanding transformer architecture. Those are specialist skills. These three are operator skills.

Every founder needs them. Which one are you weakest at?
