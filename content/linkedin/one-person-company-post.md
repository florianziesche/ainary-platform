When I founded my startup 5 years ago, I needed 15 people to build software.

Last week, I built a complete SaaS demo alone. In one day.
3,500+ lines of code. Landing page. PDF generation. Interactive app.

This isn't a flex. It's the new reality.

Sam Altman said it best:
"We're betting on when the first one-person billion-dollar company will emerge. Without AI, unimaginable. Now it's going to happen."

The math has changed:

**Before:** 1 Founder + 10 Employees = 1 Functioning Startup
**Now:** 1 Founder + AI Stack = Output of 10+ Employees

What I learned:

→ AI isn't a tool. It's a team member.
→ The best AI users think in systems, not prompts.
→ Capacity isn't your lever. Constraint is.

By end of 2026, there will be two kinds of knowledge workers:
Those with AI superpowers. And those without.

The gap is growing exponentially.
