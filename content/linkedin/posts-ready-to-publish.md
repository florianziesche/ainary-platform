## Post 1: Founder to VC (Feb 4)

```
I spent 5 years as a startup CEO.

Raised €5.5M.
Built a team of 15.
Shipped enterprise AI products.

Now I'm transitioning to VC.

Here's what surprised me about the other side of the table:

1. VCs have surprisingly little time
   Partners see 1000+ decks/year. You get 30 minutes.

2. Pattern matching is real (and flawed)
   Most VCs invest in what they've seen work before.

3. Founder empathy varies wildly
   Some get it. Some have never built anything.

4. The best VCs are operators who invest
   They've felt the pain. They add real value.

I'm documenting my transition publicly.

What surprised you most when you met with investors?

## Post 2: AI as Employee (Feb 6)

```
Stop treating AI like Google.

Question in → Answer out → Close tab

That's like hiring someone and only asking yes/no questions.

My AI assistant knows:
→ My goals for this quarter
→ Who I'm meeting this week  
→ What projects have priority
→ When I'm procrastinating

It's not ChatGPT anymore.
It's a Chief of Staff.

The shift:
AI as employee, not tool.

Here's what changed when I made the switch:

Before: Random prompts, inconsistent results
After: Persistent context, compounding value

Before: I managed tasks
After: AI manages my attention

Before: Tool among many
After: Integrated into everything

What if your AI remembered everything?
What would you delegate first?

## Post 3: One-Person Company Metrics (Feb 11)

```
Last week's output:

→ Built a SaaS demo (3,500 lines) — 1 day
→ Wrote 5 articles — 2 hours
→ Created sales presentation (15 slides) — 30 min
→ Generated 100+ pages of documentation — 2 hours

Team size: 1

Sam Altman predicts the first billion-dollar one-person company.

I'm not there yet.
But the math has changed.

Old equation:
More output = More people = More cost

New equation:
More output = Better AI leverage = Same cost

The gap between AI-native operators and everyone else is widening.

Every week, the gap gets bigger.

Which side are you on?

## Post 4: Systems vs Goals (Feb 13)

```
Goals are overrated.
Systems are underrated.

"I want to close 10 deals this quarter"
vs
"I send 5 outreach messages every day"

One is a wish.
One is a machine.

My system for job applications:

→ 3 applications per week (non-negotiable)
→ 1 networking call per day
→ 2 LinkedIn posts per week
→ Review pipeline every Sunday

The goal: Land a VC role.
The system: What actually makes it happen.

Most people optimize their goals.
Winners optimize their systems.

What's your system?

## Post 5: Hallucination Rate Story (Feb 18)

```
"5% error rate is acceptable for AI."

No. It's not.

Not when lawyers use it for real cases.
Not when one mistake costs millions.
Not when trust is everything.

We got it down to 0.18%.

Here's what we changed:

1. Multi-agent verification
   Questioner → Researcher → Validator → Reporter
   Each agent catches what others miss.

2. Hybrid retrieval
   BM25 (exact match) + Dense vectors (semantic)
   Best of both worlds.

3. Claim-level citations
   Every statement linked to source.
   No unsupported claims allowed.

4. Confidence scores
   High/Medium/Low — explicitly shown.
   Users know when to trust.

The result?
Lawyer adoption: 12% → 78%

AI isn't magic.
It's engineering.

The difference between "cool demo" and "production system" is 1000 hours of edge cases.

## Post 6: VC Lab Experience (Feb 20)

```
I just completed a VC accelerator program.

Here's what I actually learned:

Week 1: You don't know what VCs want
Week 2: Your thesis isn't a thesis
Week 3: Networking > Knowledge
Week 4: The game is relationships
Week 5: Deal flow is everything
Week 6: Your past is your unfair advantage

The biggest surprise?

VCs are just people betting on other people.

All the frameworks, models, and theory?
Secondary to: "Do I trust this person?"

If you're a founder thinking about VC:
Your operating experience IS your edge.
Not despite it. Because of it.

## Post 7: Tool Stack (Feb 25)

```
My AI stack costs €250/month.

It gives me 10x output.

Here's what's in it:

THINKING
• Claude (reasoning, complex tasks)
• Perplexity (research, citations)

BUILDING
• Claude Code (development)
• Cursor (coding assistant)

ORCHESTRATION
• OpenClaw (AI agent framework)
• n8n (automation)

KNOWLEDGE
• Obsidian (second brain)
• blogwatcher (RSS curation)

Total: ~€250/month

What I get:
• AI that remembers context
• Automated research
• 10x faster coding
• Proactive notifications

The ROI is insane.
But only if you invest time to learn.

What's in your stack?

## Post 8: The Real Skill (Feb 27)

```
In 2020, the skill was "knowing things."
In 2024, the skill was "prompting AI."
In 2026, the skill is "building systems."

Knowledge is free.
Prompts are commoditized.
Systems are leverage.

What makes a system?

→ Inputs that happen automatically
→ Processes that run without you
→ Outputs that compound over time

Example: My content system

Input: RSS feeds (automated)
Process: AI summarizes, I review
Output: 3 posts/week, growing audience

I designed it once.
It runs forever.

The new question isn't "What do you know?"
It's "What systems have you built?"
