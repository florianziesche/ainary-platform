## Week of Feb 3-9

### Tuesday Feb 4 — 08:30 CET
**Topic:** One-Person Company Announcement

```
I just published my first deep-dive article:

"Why 2026 Is the Year of the One-Person Company"

Last week I:
→ Built a SaaS demo (3,500 lines of code) — 1 day
→ Wrote 5 newsletter articles — 2 hours  
→ Automated 18 news feeds — 15 minutes

The math has changed:
1 Founder + AI Stack = Output of 10+ employees

Sam Altman is betting on the first one-person billion-dollar company.

I'm writing about what I'm learning as I build this way.

**Topic:** AI as Employee, Not Tool

```
The biggest mistake people make with AI:

They treat it like Google.
Question in → Answer out → Close tab

That's like hiring someone and only asking yes/no questions.

My AI assistant knows:
• My goals for this quarter
• Who I'm meeting this week
• What projects have priority
• When I'm procrastinating

It reminds me about follow-ups.
It researches while I sleep.
It tells me when I'm doing busywork.

This isn't ChatGPT anymore.
This is a Chief of Staff.

The shift: AI as employee, not tool.

What would change if your AI knew your goals?

## Week of Feb 10-16

### Tuesday Feb 11 — 08:30 CET
**Topic:** From Founder to VC

```
I spent 5 years as a startup CEO.

Raised €5.5M.
Built a team of 15.
Shipped enterprise AI products.

Now I'm transitioning to VC.

Here's what surprised me about the other side of the table:

1. VCs have surprisingly little time
   Partners see 1000+ decks/year. You get 30 minutes.

2. Pattern matching is real (and flawed)
   Most VCs invest in what they've seen work before.

3. Founder empathy varies wildly
   Some get it. Some have never built anything.

4. The best VCs are operators who invest
   They've felt the pain. They add real value.

I'm documenting my transition publicly.

If you're a founder thinking about VC — or a VC who values operator backgrounds — let's connect.

### Thursday Feb 13 — 08:30 CET
**Topic:** Systems Thinking for AI

```
Old work = scarce intelligence
New work = scarce judgment

Let me explain:

5 years ago, knowledge work meant:
• Finding information (hard)
• Analyzing manually (slow)
• Coordinating people (expensive)
• Producing output (time-consuming)

Today, AI handles all of that.

What's actually scarce now:
• Choosing the right problem
• Framing decisions correctly
• Designing systems that reliably deliver
• Bearing consequences (can't automate accountability)

Your new job: Governor of a decision factory.

The workers never sleep.
The capacity is unlimited.
The bottleneck is your judgment.

The best AI users don't think in tasks.
They think in systems.

What system are you building?

## Week of Feb 17-23

### Tuesday Feb 18 — 08:30 CET
**Topic:** The AI Stack That Costs €250/Month

```
My AI stack costs €250/month.

It gives me the output of a 10-person team.

Here's what's in it:

THINKING
→ Claude (primary AI)
→ Perplexity (research)

BUILDING  
→ Claude Code (development)
→ Cursor (coding assistant)

ORCHESTRATION
→ OpenClaw (my AI agent)
→ n8n (automation)

KNOWLEDGE
→ Obsidian (second brain)
→ blogwatcher (RSS curation)

COMMUNICATION
→ Telegram/WhatsApp (multi-channel)

Total: ~€250/month

What I get:
• AI that remembers everything
• Automated research + summaries
• 10x faster development
• Proactive notifications
• Compound knowledge base

The ROI is insane.

The question isn't cost. It's whether you invest the time to learn.

What's in your AI stack?

### Thursday Feb 20 — 08:30 CET
**Topic:** Winners and Losers of the AI Shift

```
Not everyone will benefit from AI.

Here's who wins and who loses:

WINNERS:
✅ People who can adapt
✅ Generalists with depth
✅ Self-starters with entrepreneurial drive
✅ Those who learn continuously

LOSERS:
❌ "We've always done it this way"
❌ Specialists who can't adapt
❌ Those betting on titles over output
❌ People waiting for permission

Vinod Khosla says AI will do 80% of work in 80% of jobs.

The gap between AI users and non-users will grow exponentially.

By end of 2026, there will be two kinds of knowledge workers:
Those with AI superpowers.
And those without.

Which one are you becoming?

## Week of Feb 24 - Mar 2

### Tuesday Feb 25 — 08:30 CET
**Topic:** Compound Knowledge

```
Every week, my AI reads 144 articles.

I get the 5-10 insights that actually matter.

15 minutes instead of 3 hours.

But here's the real power:

After 3 months, I have a searchable knowledge base that compounds.

When I meet a founder in vertical X:
→ Pull up everything I've learned
→ Instant context
→ Better questions
→ Deeper insights

Most people consume content and forget it.

I consume content and compound it.

The difference after a year is massive.

What's your system for compounding knowledge?

### Thursday Feb 27 — 08:30 CET
**Topic:** Lessons from Building AI Products

```
I built an AI product with <0.2% hallucination rate.

Here's what I learned:

1. RAG isn't magic
   Retrieval quality > model quality
   Garbage in, garbage out

2. Multi-agent > single agent
   Questioner → Researcher → Validator → Reporter
   Each step catches errors

3. Users don't trust "AI says"
   Show your sources
   Make verification easy

4. Prompts are code
   Version them
   Test them
   Document them

5. The hard part isn't the AI
   It's the data pipeline
   It's the edge cases
   It's the user trust

Building AI products is 20% AI, 80% engineering.

What's the hardest part of your AI project?
