2026 is the year of the one-person company.

Last week I:
→ Built a complete SaaS demo (3,500 lines of code) — 1 day
→ Wrote 5 newsletter articles — 2 hours
→ Automated 18 news feeds — 15 minutes
→ Created a 3,000-word research brief — 30 minutes

All with AI. All alongside other projects.

When I started my startup 5 years ago, I needed a team of 10.
Today: 1 founder + AI stack = output of 10+ employees.

The math has changed.

Sam Altman is betting on the first one-person billion-dollar company.
Vinod Khosla says AI will do 80% of work in 80% of jobs.

Here's what I've learned:

1. AI isn't a tool — it's a team member
   My AI agent knows my goals, my calendar, my priorities.
   It's not ChatGPT. It's a Chief of Staff.

2. The best AI users think in systems
   Old work: scarce intelligence
   New work: scarce judgment
   Your job: Governor of a decision factory.

3. Not everyone will benefit
   Winners: adapters, generalists, self-starters
   Losers: "we've always done it this way"

By end of 2026, there will be two kinds of knowledge workers:
Those with AI superpowers. And those without.

Which one are you?

2026 is the year of the one-person company.

Last week I built a SaaS demo, wrote 5 articles, automated 18 feeds, and created a research brief.

Total time: ~8 hours.

Here's how AI changed the math 🧵

```
5 years ago I needed a team of 10 to build software.

Today:
1 Founder + AI Stack = Output of 10+ employees

Sam Altman is betting on the first one-person billion-dollar company.

It's happening.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The mistake most people make:

They treat AI like Google.
Question in, answer out, done.

That's like hiring someone and only asking yes/no questions.

My AI agent knows my goals, my calendar, my work style.
It reminds me when I'm procrastinating.

This is a Chief of Staff.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Old work = scarce intelligence
→ Finding info, manual analysis, coordinating people

New work = scarce judgment
→ Choosing problems, framing decisions, designing systems

You're not a worker anymore.
You're a governor of a decision factory.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Who wins from this shift?

✅ People who can adapt
✅ Generalists with depth
✅ Self-starters

Who loses?

❌ "We've always done it this way"
❌ Specialists who can't adapt
❌ Those betting on titles over output
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
The first step is simple:

Take one task that annoys you this week.
Ask: "How would I solve this with AI?"
Try it.

The one-person company isn't a future vision.
It's available today.

Are you using it?
