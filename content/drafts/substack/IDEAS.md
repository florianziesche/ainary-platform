# Substack Article Ideas — Finite Matter

### "What My AI Taught Me About Myself"
**Hook:** I built an AI system to make me more productive. Instead, it became a mirror.
**Core Thesis:** AI doesn't just amplify output — it exposes your patterns. The good ones AND the ones you've been hiding from.
**Angle:** The 6 patterns AI revealed:
1. Quality instinct vs. articulated rules (you see it before you can name it)
2. "Research first, then build" — thinking before doing beats doing before thinking
3. Your authentic voice is always stronger than polished AI output
4. Cross-domain thinking is the real compound advantage (not knowledge storage)
5. Refusing to accept first drafts is the rarest and most valuable skill
6. The meta-question ("how do I work?") separates linear from exponential
**Why this works:** Counterintuitive (AI article that's actually about human skills), personal but universal, positions Florian as self-aware operator, aligns with "human-in-the-loop" discourse
**Content Pillars:** Pillar 1 (AI-Native Operating) + Pillar 2 (Founder Transition)
**SEO Keywords:** "AI self-improvement", "AI productivity lessons", "what AI teaches about work"
**Trend-Anschluss:** Mollick's "Cyborg" research — the best performers aren't the ones who use AI most, they're the ones who know WHEN to override it
