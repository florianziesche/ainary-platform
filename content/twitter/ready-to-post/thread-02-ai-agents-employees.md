# Thread 2 — Running a Company with AI Agents as Employees

**Tweet 1:**
I run a company with AI agents as employees.

Not as tools. As actual team members with roles, KPIs, and performance reviews.

Here's how it works in practice:

🧵

My current "org chart":

- Research Agent: 200+ sources/day
- Content Agent: drafts, edits, formats
- Outreach Agent: personalized emails + follow-ups
- Ops Agent: calendar, files, task management
- Analysis Agent: reports, metrics, anomaly detection

Total salary cost: $0

The biggest mental shift:

Stop thinking "AI tool I use sometimes."

Start thinking "team member with a job description."

When I wrote actual role descriptions for each agent, the output quality jumped immediately.

**Tweet 4:**
How I onboard a new AI agent:

1. Define the role (what, not how)
2. Give it context (who am I, what's the business, what matters)
3. Set boundaries (what it can do alone vs. what needs my approval)
4. Start with zero autonomy
5. Expand permissions as trust builds

Same process I used for human hires. Works just as well.

**Tweet 5:**
The performance review is real.

Every week I check:
- Did the agent complete its tasks?
- Quality of output (1-5 scale)
- False positives / errors
- Time saved vs. doing it myself

Bad performance = system update.
Good performance = more autonomy.

**Tweet 6:**
Mistake I made early: giving agents too much freedom.

My outreach agent sent 40 emails with a tone that didn't sound like me. No damage done, but I learned: new agents get training wheels.

Now: first 50 outputs get manual review. No exceptions.

**Tweet 7:**
The delegation framework:

Ask yourself: "Would I give this task to a smart intern with no context?"

Yes → AI agent can handle it (with guardrails)
No → You do it, or AI assists while you decide

Most of your work is in the "yes" bucket. You just haven't decomposed it yet.

**Tweet 8:**
What I still do myself:

- Strategic decisions
- Relationship building
- Creative direction
- Final approval on anything public-facing
- Anything involving judgment calls with limited data

AI handles the other 70-80% of my working hours.

**Tweet 9:**
The economics:

Before AI agents: ~60 hours/week of work
After: ~25 hours of my time + agents running 24/7

Output: roughly 3x what I produced before
Cost: ~$400/month in API and tools
ROI: absurd

**Tweet 10:**
The part nobody talks about: managing AI agents is still management.

You still need to:
- Set clear expectations
- Provide feedback
- Iterate on processes
- Handle edge cases

It's faster than managing humans. But it's not zero effort.

My prediction:

By 2027, "AI agent management" will be a real job title.

Companies will hire people whose entire role is designing, deploying, and optimizing AI agent teams.

The skills: part product manager, part ops, part prompt architect.

Start building this skill now.
