# Thread 3 — From Founder to VC: What I've Learned Switching Sides

**Tweet 1:**
I spent years as a startup CEO. Raised $5M+. Built teams. Shipped product.

Now I'm moving to the investor side.

Here's what I've learned switching from founder to VC:

🧵

The first shock: how little context investors have.

As a founder, you live inside your company 24/7. You know every detail.

As an investor, you get a 30-minute pitch and a deck. You're making million-dollar decisions on a fraction of the information.

It's humbling.

**Tweet 3:**
What I now know VCs actually look for (that founders miss):

It's not the TAM slide. It's not the hockey stick projections.

It's: "Does this founder understand the problem so deeply that they'll navigate the 47 pivots between here and product-market fit?"

**Tweet 4:**
The biggest gap between founders and investors: time horizon.

Founders think in sprints. Ship this feature. Close this deal. Hit this quarter's target.

VCs think in decades. Will this market matter in 10 years? Will this team endure?

Both are right. Neither fully gets the other.

**Tweet 5:**
What I wish every VC knew about operating:

- Your "quick question" email costs the founder 2 hours of context switching
- Monthly reporting during a crisis feels like filing taxes during a house fire
- "Have you tried X?" -- yes, 6 months ago, it didn't work, here's why

**Tweet 6:**
What I wish every founder knew about VCs:

- They see 1000+ deals a year and fund maybe 10
- Most "no"s aren't about you -- it's portfolio fit, timing, or fund strategy
- The best VCs are genuinely trying to help, they just have 30 portfolio companies

The operator advantage in VC:

I can look at a startup's architecture and know if it'll scale.
I can read a pitch deck and spot where the real risk is hiding.
I can talk to a technical founder without needing a translator.

This pattern recognition is the most valuable thing I bring.

**Tweet 8:**
What surprised me most: how much VC is a people business.

I expected spreadsheets and analysis. The reality is 80% relationships.

Who do you know? Who trusts you? Who will take your call?

Same as startups, honestly. The best deals come through warm intros, not cold applications.

**Tweet 9:**
The hardest part of the switch: letting go of control.

As a CEO, I could decide and execute in the same hour.

As an investor, I advise and then watch. The founder executes. Sometimes differently than I would.

Learning to influence without controlling is a real skill.

**Tweet 10:**
My thesis for what I want to invest in:

- AI applied to unsexy, massive industries (manufacturing, logistics, legal)
- Founders who've felt the pain they're solving
- Systems that get better with usage (data moats > model moats)
- Teams that ship weekly, not quarterly

Operator-built companies for real-world problems.

The meta lesson:

Every career transition feels like starting over. But your skills compound in unexpected ways.

Fundraising experience makes me a better investor.
Operating experience makes me a better board member.
Building AI makes me a better evaluator of AI companies.

Nothing is wasted.

If you're considering founder → VC:

1. Do it for the right reasons (impact at scale, not escaping operations)
2. Your operating experience is your edge -- lead with it
3. Start angel investing now to build deal flow and judgment
4. Stay technical. Operators who stop building lose their edge fast.

The world needs more investors who've actually built things.
