## Thread (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I built an AI Chief of Staff that:

• Knows my goals for the quarter
• Tracks my calendar and deadlines
• Reminds me when I'm procrastinating
• Works while I sleep

Here's exactly how I set it up (and you can too):

🧵👇
```

### Tweet 2
```
First, the mindset shift:

Stop treating AI like a search engine.

Old: "Hey ChatGPT, what's the capital of France?"
New: "Hey Mia, what should I focus on today given my Q1 goals?"

AI as employee > AI as tool.
```

### Tweet 3
```
The foundation: Persistent memory.

Your AI needs context to be useful.

I created these files:
• USER.md — Who I am, my goals, preferences
• MEMORY.md — What it's learned about me
• SOUL.md — How it should behave

My AI reads these every session.
```

### Tweet 4
```
Here's what's in my USER.md:

• Current priorities (ranked)
• Working style (direct, no fluff)
• Peak hours (when to push me)
• Quiet hours (when not to disturb)
• Key people in my life
• Financial goals

The more context, the better the output.
```

### Tweet 5
```
SOUL.md is where personality lives:

"Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful."
"Push back when I'm procrastinating."
"Have opinions. An AI with no personality is just a search engine."

This isn't prompt engineering.
It's designing a colleague.
```

### Tweet 6
```
The daily rhythm:

Morning: AI checks my calendar, surfaces priorities
During day: Available for questions, research, drafts
Evening: Captures what happened, updates memory
Night: Runs background tasks (research, monitoring)

24/7 coverage. €250/month.
```

### Tweet 7
```
The proactive part is key.

Every few hours, my AI:
• Checks if deadlines are approaching
• Scans RSS feeds for relevant news
• Looks at my pipeline (jobs, leads)
• Nudges me if I've been silent too long

It doesn't wait. It initiates.
```

### Tweet 8
```
Real example from yesterday:

AI: "You haven't sent any job applications this week. Your goal is 3/week. You have 2 days left. Want me to pull up your target list?"

That's accountability that doesn't sleep.
```

### Tweet 9
```
The stack that makes this work:

• Claude (brain)
• OpenClaw (orchestration)
• Obsidian (knowledge base)
• Telegram (communication)
• n8n (automation)

Total cost: ~€250/month
Value: Easily €5,000+/month in time saved
```

### Tweet 10
```
What took longest to get right:

1. Memory structure (2 weeks of iteration)
2. When to be proactive vs silent (still tuning)
3. Voice/personality (it's an art)
4. Tool integrations (calendar, email, etc.)

Start simple. Add complexity gradually.
```

### Tweet 11
```
The compound effect is insane.

Week 1: Awkward, lots of correction needed
Week 4: Starting to "get" me
Week 12: Genuinely useful partner
Week 52: Can't imagine working without it

The AI gets better because it learns about YOU specifically.
```
