## Week of Feb 3-9

### Monday Feb 3
**Type:** Article Promo (English)
```
2026 is the year of the one-person company.

Last week I built a SaaS demo, wrote 5 articles, automated 18 feeds.

Total time: ~8 hours. All with AI.

Here's how the math changed 🧵

### Tuesday Feb 4
**Type:** Quick Insight
```
The biggest AI mistake:

Treating it like Google.

Question in → Answer out → Done.

That's like hiring someone and only asking yes/no questions.

Treat AI like an employee. Give it context. Give it memory. Give it autonomy.

The ROI is 10x.
```

### Wednesday Feb 5
**Type:** Personal
```
5 years as a startup CEO.
€5.5M raised.
Team of 15.

Now transitioning to VC.

Biggest surprise so far: How few VCs have actually built things.

The best ones have. They add real value.

The rest pattern match from the sideline.
```

### Thursday Feb 6
**Type:** Framework
```
Old work = scarce intelligence
New work = scarce judgment

AI handles: finding info, analysis, coordination, output.

You handle: choosing problems, framing decisions, accountability.

You're not a worker anymore.

You're a governor of a decision factory.
```

### Friday Feb 7
**Type:** List
```
My €250/month AI stack:

• Claude (thinking)
• Claude Code (building)
• Perplexity (research)
• OpenClaw (orchestration)
• Obsidian (knowledge)
• n8n (automation)

Output: 10x
ROI: Insane

What's in your stack?
```

### Saturday Feb 8
**Type:** Observation
```
Sam Altman is betting on the first one-person billion-dollar company.

Vinod Khosla says AI will do 80% of work in 80% of jobs.

By end of 2026: Two kinds of knowledge workers.

Those with AI superpowers.
Those without.

The clock is ticking.
```

### Sunday Feb 9
**Type:** Question
```
Honest question for founders:

Are you building AI-native from day one?

Or retrofitting AI onto existing workflows?

The difference is architectural.

And it compounds.

New article: How I Built My AI Chief of Staff

From ChatGPT user to running a digital team.

Mia knows my calendar, my goals, my projects. She reminds me about follow-ups and tells me when I'm procrastinating.

Here's the architecture 🧵

### Tuesday Feb 11
**Type:** Hot Take
```
Hot take: Most "AI startups" are just ChatGPT wrappers.

Real AI-native companies:
• Redesign workflows from first principles
• Build for AI operators, human governors
• Create data flywheels that compound

Everything else is a feature, not a company.
```

### Wednesday Feb 12
**Type:** Story
```
3 months ago: AI = occasional tool

Today: AI = Chief of Staff with memory

What changed?

I stopped treating AI like Google.
I started treating it like an employee.

Onboarding. Context. Feedback. Autonomy.

Same AI. 10x the value.
```

### Thursday Feb 13
**Type:** Contrarian
```
Unpopular opinion:

You don't need to learn coding in 2026.

You need to learn prompting.
You need to learn systems thinking.
You need to learn how to manage AI.

The skill gap isn't technical.
It's managerial.
```

### Friday Feb 14
**Type:** Lesson
```
Lesson from building AI products:

The hard part isn't the AI.

It's:
• Data quality
• Edge cases
• User trust
• Integration
• Maintenance

Building AI = 20% AI, 80% engineering.

Don't skip the 80%.
```
