3. **Actionable insights:** Not just "here's the problem," but "here's what works"
4. **Data-driven:** Specific numbers, referenced papers, replicable experiments
5. **Contrarian positioning:** While everyone talks capability, Florian focuses on architecture/calibration

**Audience fit:**
- VCs: "This person reads research AND builds"
- Hiring managers: "Operator who thinks deeply"
- AI builders: "Practical insights I can use today"
