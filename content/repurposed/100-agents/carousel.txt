SLIDE 1 (HOOK):
The Experiment:
10 groups of AI agents
Same question
10 completely different thinking strategies
33,000 words of output
6 laws converged

SLIDE 2:
Law 1: Files = Intelligence
(10/10 groups agreed)

AI doesn't improve by getting smarter.
It improves by getting better-informed.

Your AI's intelligence lives in a folder on your hard drive.
Not in a data center.

SLIDE 3:
Law 2: The Pair is the Unit
(9/10 groups)

You can't optimize AI in isolation.
Human changes → AI adapts
AI changes → Human adapts

They co-evolve.
AI alignment isn't just safety.
It's a relationship problem.

SLIDE 4:
Law 3: Multi-Timescale Loops
(8/10 groups)

Need feedback at EVERY timescale:
→ Per-interaction (seconds)
→ Per-session (hours)
→ Weekly
→ Monthly
→ Quarterly

Most AI: one loop (the chat). Everything else lost.

SLIDE 5:
Law 4: Legibility > Optimization
(8/10 groups)

Transparency beats performance.

An agent you can see through is more valuable than one that performs better but opaquely.

Most important feature isn't accuracy.
It's showing your work.

SLIDE 6:
Law 5: Failures = Signal
(8/10 groups)

Corrections = more info than successes.

"Perfect" = no signal
"No, I meant X" = exact gap location

Kintsugi: Repair broken pottery with gold.
Make errors visible. Turn them into assets.

SLIDE 7:
Law 6: Specificity Engine
(7/10 groups)

Agent improves by getting MORE specific to this human.
Not more generally capable.

After 6 months learning one person:
irreplaceable.

Industry optimizes for generality.
Value moves opposite.

SLIDE 8:
What didn't converge: The Dangerous Ideas

Belief Graveyard (log killed assumptions)
Stochastic Resonance (controlled noise reveals hidden needs)
Red Team / Blue Team (internal adversary before changes)
Complementary Voice (thinking style should differ from user)
Improvement at Speed of Trust (don't outpace human's ability to verify)

SLIDE 9:
Cost: Few dollars in API calls
Time: One afternoon
Output: 33,000 words (research team = weeks)

Small model + 50 curated files
beats
Large model + zero context

Every. Single. Time.

SLIDE 10 (CTA):
Architecture Checklist for AI Agents:

✓ Memory in user-editable files?
✓ Track failures visibly?
✓ Multi-timescale feedback?
✓ Gets more specific over time?
✓ Shows its work?

We're on day one of something without a name yet.
