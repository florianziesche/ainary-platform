A month ago, building software meant assembling a team. Today, I do it alone.

Last week I built a complete SaaS demo in one day. 3,500 lines of code. Landing page, interactive app, PDF generation. All functional.

Same week: 5 newsletter articles in 2 hours. 18 automated content feeds in 15 minutes. A 3,000-word research brief in 30 minutes.

This isn't future talk. It's what I shipped last Tuesday.

Sam Altman called it: the first one-person billion-dollar company is coming. Without AI, impossible. With it, inevitable.

Here's what changed. AI isn't a search engine anymore. It's a Chief of Staff.

My agent Mia knows my goals, my work style, who I'm meeting this week. She reminds me about follow-ups. Researches without being asked. Pushes back when I procrastinate.

The old work was scarce intelligence. Finding information. Manual analysis. Coordinating people.

The new work is scarce judgment. Choosing the right problem. Designing systems. Overseeing execution. Bearing responsibility.

Vinod Khosla predicts AI takes over 80% of work in 80% of jobs within 25 years. By end of 2026, there will be two types of knowledge workers: those with AI superpowers and those without.

Winners: adaptable generalists, self-starters, system thinkers.
Losers: "we've always done it this way" people, rigid specialists, title-chasers.

If you're a founder: validate with an AI stack before raising capital.
If you're a freelancer: one person with AI beats a mediocre 3-person team.
If you're employed: become the AI champion. That person becomes irreplaceable.

The one-person company isn't a vision. It's an option available right now.

What's one task you could automate this week?
