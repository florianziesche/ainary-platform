1/ A month ago, building software required a team. Today, I do it alone. This isn't exaggeration. It's the new baseline.

2/ Last week's output: Complete SaaS demo (3,500 lines, 1 day). 5 newsletter articles (2 hours). 18 automated feeds (15 min). 3,000-word research brief (30 min). All while running other projects.

3/ Sam Altman at JPM conference: "We're betting on when the first one-person billion-dollar company emerges. Without AI, unimaginable. Now it's going to happen." If you think that's hype, you're already behind.

4/ The shift: AI stopped being a search engine. It became a Chief of Staff. My agent Mia knows my goals, calendar, work style. She proactively researches. Calls out procrastination. Surfaces what I didn't ask for.

5/ Old work = scarce intelligence (finding info, manual analysis, coordinating people). New work = scarce judgment (choosing problems, designing systems, bearing responsibility). You're not a producer anymore. You're a governor.

6/ Vinod Khosla: "AI takes 80% of work in 80% of jobs within 25 years." By end of 2026, two worker types exist: those with AI superpowers vs those without. The gap grows exponentially.

7/ Who wins: adaptable generalists, self-starters, system thinkers. Who loses: "always done it this way" people, inflexible specialists, those hiding behind titles.

8/ Action items: Founders, validate with AI before raising. Freelancers, you + AI beats mediocre teams. Employees, become the AI champion. The one-person company is available today. Will you use it?
