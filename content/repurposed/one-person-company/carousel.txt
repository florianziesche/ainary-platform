SLIDE 1 (HOOK):
A month ago: 1 founder + 10 employees = 1 startup
Today: 1 founder + AI stack = output of 10+ people
This isn't future talk. It's what I shipped last Tuesday.

SLIDE 2:
Last week's output:
→ Complete SaaS demo (3,500 lines)
→ 5 newsletter articles
→ 18 automated content feeds
→ 3,000-word research brief
→ Full content strategy visualization
Time: 1 week. Team size: 1.

SLIDE 3:
Sam Altman (JPM Conference 2024):
"We're betting on when the first one-person billion-dollar company emerges. Without AI: unimaginable. With AI: inevitable."

SLIDE 4:
The shift nobody talks about:
AI stopped being a search engine.
It became a Chief of Staff.
Knows your goals. Your calendar. Your work style.
Proactive, not reactive.

SLIDE 5:
Old work = scarce intelligence
→ Finding information
→ Manual analysis
→ Coordinating people
→ Producing outputs

SLIDE 6:
New work = scarce judgment
→ Choosing the right problem
→ Designing systems
→ Overseeing execution
→ Bearing responsibility
You're not a producer. You're a governor.

SLIDE 7:
Vinod Khosla's prediction:
"AI takes 80% of work in 80% of jobs within 25 years"

By end of 2026: two worker types
→ Those with AI superpowers
→ Those without

SLIDE 8:
Winners:
→ Adaptable generalists
→ Self-starters
→ System thinkers

Losers:
→ "We've always done it this way"
→ Rigid specialists
→ Title-chasers

SLIDE 9:
Action items:
Founders: Validate with AI before raising
Freelancers: You + AI beats mediocre teams
Employees: Become the AI champion

SLIDE 10 (CTA):
The one-person company isn't a vision.
It's an option available today.
