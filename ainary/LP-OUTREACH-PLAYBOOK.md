## 2. LP Segmentation

### Who's Realistic for Fund I — Be Honest

**The brutal truth:** Institutions (pensions, endowments, fund-of-funds) won't invest in your Fund I. Don't waste time.

### Tier 1: Your Money (Highest Probability)

| LP Type | Realistic Check | Conversion | Notes |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------|
| **Personal network (HNWIs)** | $25K–$100K | 15–25% | Friends, former colleagues, founders you know |
| **Angel investors looking to scale** | $50K–$250K | 10–20% | Angels who want diversification via fund |
| **Former startup ecosystem contacts** | $25K–$100K | 10–15% | People who saw you build, know your judgment |
| **VC Lab cohort peers** | $25K–$50K | 5–10% | Cross-invest, signal commitment |

### Tier 2: Warm-able Money (Medium Probability)

| LP Type | Realistic Check | Conversion | Notes |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------|
| **Small family offices ($50M–$500M AUM)** | $100K–$500K | 3–8% | Need personal intro; 78% plan AI investments (UBS 2025) |
| **Tech operators with liquidity events** | $50K–$250K | 5–15% | Sold startups, sitting on cash, understand VC |
| **German Mittelstand owners** | $50K–$250K | 3–10% | Your manufacturing AI thesis resonates; they GET the problem |
| **Emerging manager programs** | $250K–$1M | 2–5% | Competitive but designed for you |

### Tier 3: Institutional (Fund II Targets — Plant Seeds Now)

| LP Type | Realistic Check | Why Not Now |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Fund-of-funds** | $500K–$2M | Need track record; min. $10M fund usually |
| **University endowments** | $1M+ | 12–18 month diligence cycle |
| **Pension allocators** | $1M+ | Min. fund size usually $25M+ |
| **Sovereign wealth** | Don't bother | Not for Fund I |

### Target LP Pipeline Math

To raise $5M, you need:
- **Target 100 qualified conversations** (serious, not coffee chats)
- **Expect 15–25 to commit** (15–25% conversion on warm, lower on cold)
- **Average check: $200K–$333K**
- **Build a pipeline of 200+ names** (only half will take a meeting)

## 3. Warm Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Former Colleague / Founder Friend

**Subject:** Quick question about something I'm building

```
Hey [Name],

Hope you're well. I wanted to share something I've been working on and get your honest take.

I'm launching a venture fund — Ainary Ventures — focused on pre-seed/seed AI-native B2B companies. The thesis is rooted in what I've seen firsthand: AI isn't just a feature anymore, it's restructuring entire industries (manufacturing, logistics, enterprise ops). The founders building in this space need investors who actually understand the tech, not just the TAM slides.

My background building and scaling AI companies (raised €5.5M+, built products used in production) gives me a lens most VCs don't have. I'm doing this through VC Lab / Decile Group, which has launched 900+ VC firms globally.

I'm raising a $5M Fund I. I'd love to:
1. Get your feedback on the thesis
2. Explore if this might be interesting for you or someone in your network

No pressure at all — I value your perspective either way. Could we grab 20 minutes this week or next?

Best,
Florian
```

### Template 2: Angel Investor Looking to Diversify

**Subject:** A way to scale your angel investing

```
Hi [Name],

I've followed your angel investments in [sector] — great picks, especially [specific company]. I'm reaching out because I think there's a compelling alignment.

I'm launching Ainary Ventures Fund I ($5M target), investing $100K–$250K checks into pre-seed/seed AI-native B2B startups. My thesis: the best AI companies are being built at the intersection of deep technical understanding and real industry problems — manufacturing, enterprise operations, vertical SaaS with AI at the core.

Why this might interest you:
- **Diversification:** 20–30 companies vs. betting on 3–5 as an angel
- **Access:** Deal flow from VC Lab network (900+ firms), NYC + European ecosystem
- **Operator lens:** I've raised €5.5M+ and built AI products in production — I evaluate founders differently than career VCs

Minimum commitment is $[X]. Would love to walk you through the thesis and portfolio construction over a 30-minute call.

Worth a conversation?

Florian
```

### Template 3: Tech Operator with Liquidity

**Subject:** From operator to investor — a thesis that might resonate

```
Hi [Name],

Congrats on [exit/liquidity event/role]. Having gone through the operator journey myself (CEO, raised €5.5M+, built AI/cloud products), I know the transition from building to investing is a natural next step for people like us.

I'm launching Ainary Ventures, a pre-seed/seed fund investing in AI-native B2B startups. The edge: I evaluate founders the way operators do — can they actually build the thing, not just pitch the vision?

My dual US/EU presence (based in NYC, deep German/European manufacturing network) gives me access to a deal funnel most US-only funds miss. And the AI-in-industry thesis is just getting started.

I'd love to share the deck and get your take. Even if investing isn't the right fit, your perspective as an operator would be invaluable.

20 minutes?

Florian
```

### Template 4: Family Office (Warm Intro Available)

**Subject:** [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out — AI venture fund

```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual Connection] mentioned you might be interested in early-stage AI exposure and suggested I reach out.

I'm Florian Ziesche, GP at Ainary Ventures. We're raising a $5M Fund I focused on pre-seed/seed AI-native B2B companies — think applied AI in manufacturing, enterprise operations, and vertical SaaS.

Why this fund:
- **AI is the #1 family office investment priority** — 78% of FOs plan to invest in AI in the next 2–3 years (UBS 2025)
- **Small fund = better access** — we get into oversubscribed rounds larger funds can't touch
- **Operator-GP** — I've built and shipped AI products, not just evaluated them from the sidelines

I've attached a brief one-pager. Happy to walk through the full thesis at your convenience.

Best regards,
Florian Ziesche
GP, Ainary Ventures
```

### Template 5: German Mittelstand Owner / Industrialist

**Subject:** KI-Ventures: Frühphasen-Investments in die Zukunft der Industrie

```
Sehr geehrte/r [Name],

als Unternehmer/in im produzierenden Gewerbe kennen Sie die Herausforderung: KI verändert gerade fundamental, wie Fertigung, Logistik und Qualitätssicherung funktionieren. Die Frage ist nicht ob, sondern wer die Tools baut, die Ihre Branche neu definieren.

Ich gründe Ainary Ventures — einen Frühphasen-Venture-Fund, der genau in diese AI-nativen B2B-Startups investiert. Mein Hintergrund: Ich habe selbst als CEO ein AI/Cloud-Unternehmen aufgebaut (€5,5M+ Kapital eingeworben) und kenne die Fertigungsindustrie aus eigener Erfahrung.

Warum das für Sie interessant sein könnte:
- **Frühzeitig Zugang** zu den Technologien, die Ihre Branche transformieren
- **Portfolio-Diversifikation** in 20-30 Startups statt Einzelwetten
- **Insider-Perspektive** eines Operators, der sowohl Technologie als auch Industrie versteht

Ich würde Ihnen gerne in 20 Minuten die Investmentthese vorstellen. Natürlich auf Deutsch.

Mit besten Grüßen,
Florian Ziesche
GP, Ainary Ventures
```

## 4. Cold Outreach Templates

### Cold Outreach Rules
1. **Research the LP for 10 minutes minimum** before writing
2. **Reference something specific** about them (portfolio, blog post, speech, company)
3. **Keep it under 150 words** — cold emails die at 200+
4. **One clear CTA** — don't ask for money, ask for a conversation
5. **Follow up exactly 5 business days later** if no response

### Template 1: The Insight-Led Approach

**Subject:** Your [portfolio company] investment + a thesis alignment

```
Hi [Name],

Your investment in [Company X] caught my attention — [specific reason: "the applied AI in logistics angle is exactly where I see the most founder activity"].

I'm raising a $5M pre-seed/seed fund (Ainary Ventures) focused exclusively on AI-native B2B. My background: former AI startup CEO, €5.5M+ raised, products deployed in manufacturing and enterprise.

I'm not pitching you today — I'd genuinely love to hear how you think about the AI-B2B intersection from the LP side. 15 minutes?

Florian Ziesche
```

### Template 2: The Data-Led Approach

**Subject:** 78% of family offices are investing in AI — here's how we're positioned

```
Hi [Name],

A quick stat: 78% of family offices plan AI investments in the next 2–3 years (UBS 2025), but most VC funds they access are generalist or consumer-focused.

Ainary Ventures Fund I ($5M) is purpose-built for this gap: pre-seed/seed AI-native B2B companies, sourced from both NYC and European ecosystems. I'm a former AI startup CEO with deep technical + commercial experience.

If AI is part of your allocation thesis, I'd love 15 minutes to share how we're approaching it differently.

Florian
```

### Template 3: The Mutual Community Approach

**Subject:** Fellow [VC Lab / Decile Group / industry] connection

```
Hi [Name],

We haven't met directly, but we're both in the [VC Lab / Decile / specific community] orbit. I noticed your focus on [their focus area] and thought there might be an interesting alignment.

I'm launching Ainary Ventures — a pre-seed/seed AI-B2B fund. My differentiation: operator background (built and shipped AI products), dual US/EU deal flow, and a thesis that AI's biggest value creation is in enterprise/industry, not consumer.

Raising $5M for Fund I. Would love to get your perspective — even just a quick 15-min exchange.

Florian
```

### Template 4: The Event Follow-Up (Post-Conference)

**Subject:** Great to connect at [Event] — AI fund thesis

```
Hi [Name],

We briefly crossed paths at [Event/Panel/Dinner]. Your comment about [specific thing they said] stuck with me.

I'm raising Ainary Ventures Fund I ($5M) — pre-seed/seed AI-native B2B. The thesis maps directly to what you mentioned about [connect to their comment].

Would love to continue the conversation. Free for 20 minutes next week?

Florian
```

### Template 5: The LinkedIn Warm-Up (Pre-Email)

**Step 1: Connect on LinkedIn with a note:**
```
Hi [Name] — I'm launching an AI-focused venture fund and your work in [area] is highly relevant to our thesis. Would love to connect.
```

**Step 2: After they accept (wait 2–3 days), send a DM:**
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]. Quick context: I'm raising a $5M pre-seed/seed fund (Ainary Ventures) focused on AI-native B2B. Former AI startup CEO, now applying that operator lens to venture.

I'd love to share a one-pager if you're exploring early-stage AI exposure. No pressure — happy to just exchange perspectives.
```

**Step 3: If they engage, move to email with the deck.**

## 6. Due Diligence Prep

### What LPs Will Ask — Prepare Answers BEFORE You Need Them

#### Category 1: The GP (You)

| Question | Your Prepared Answer |
|----------|---------------------|
| "What's your track record?" | "I've been an operator and investor. As CEO, I raised €5.5M+ and built AI products deployed in production. As an angel/advisor, I've worked with X startups. My edge isn't paper returns — it's technical judgment and operator empathy that career VCs can't match." |
| "Why are you leaving operating to do this?" | "I'm not leaving — I'm applying 10+ years of building to the other side of the table. The best seed investors are former founders. I understand what makes AI startups succeed AND fail at the technical level." |
| "What's your GP commitment?" | "2–5% of the fund ($100K–$250K). This is meaningful relative to my net worth. I have significant skin in the game." |
| "Who else is on the team?" | "Fund I is a solo GP fund by design — lower overhead, faster decisions. I have [X advisors/venture partners] for diligence and deal flow. Fund II will expand the team based on Fund I's results." |
| "What if something happens to you?" (Key Person) | "The LPA includes a key person clause. In the event of my incapacity, [contingency plan: advisory board steps in, orderly wind-down, etc.]." |

#### Category 2: The Strategy

| Question | Your Prepared Answer |
|----------|---------------------|
| "Why AI-native B2B specifically?" | "Three reasons: (1) I have deep domain expertise here — I've built this. (2) AI's biggest economic impact is in enterprise/industry, not consumer. (3) This space is underserved at pre-seed — most AI funds write $2M+ checks." |
| "What's your edge in deal flow?" | "Three channels: (1) VC Lab/Decile network of 900+ firms for co-invest and referrals. (2) NYC tech ecosystem — I'm embedded, not visiting. (3) German/EU manufacturing network — unique pipeline that US-only funds can't access." |
| "How do you evaluate AI startups differently?" | "I can read the code, assess the architecture, and judge whether the AI is real or a wrapper. Most VCs can't distinguish a fine-tuned GPT wrapper from a genuinely novel approach. I can." |
| "What's your follow-on strategy?" | "30–40% reserved for follow-ons. We follow into winners' Seed/Series A rounds. For the strongest companies, we'll leverage the VC Lab network for syndication." |

#### Category 3: Fund Terms & Economics

| Question | Your Prepared Answer |
|----------|---------------------|
| "What are your fees?" | "2% annual management fee on committed capital during the investment period (years 1–3), then 2% on invested capital during the harvest period. 20% carried interest with an 8% preferred return (hurdle rate). Standard for emerging managers." |
| "What's the fund term?" | "10 years with two 1-year extensions. Investment period is 3 years." |
| "What's the minimum LP commitment?" | "$[50K–100K — you decide]. We want LPs who are meaningfully committed but also want to keep the fund accessible." |
| "How often do you report?" | "Quarterly written reports + annual meeting. LPs get real-time access to a dashboard. I believe in radical transparency — you'll know what I know." |

#### Category 4: Returns & Risk

| Question | Your Prepared Answer |
|----------|---------------------|
| "What returns do you target?" | "3–5x net MOIC over the fund life, which translates to ~25–35% net IRR. This is consistent with top-quartile emerging manager performance. I'd rather underpromise and overdeliver." |
| "What if the AI market corrects?" | "Our thesis isn't 'AI hype' — it's 'AI applied to real business problems.' B2B AI companies have real revenue, real customers, and real unit economics from early stages. A correction in AI consumer/hype actually helps us: valuations drop, talent becomes available, and serious builders stand out." |
| "When will I see DPI (distributions)?" | "Realistically, first meaningful liquidity events in years 3–5. Some earlier exits possible via M&A. Full fund returns in years 7–10. I'm transparent: VC is a long game." |

## 8. Minimum Viable Fund

### Can You Start With Less Than $5M?

**Yes. And you should seriously consider it.**

### The Math at Different Fund Sizes

| Fund Size | Mgmt Fee (2%/yr) | Your Take-Home | # Investments | Check Size | GP Commit (2%) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **$1M** | $20K/yr | ~$17K/yr* | 8–10 | $50K–$100K | $20K |
| **$2M** | $40K/yr | ~$34K/yr* | 12–15 | $75K–$150K | $40K |
| **$3M** | $60K/yr | ~$51K/yr* | 15–20 | $100K–$175K | $60K |
| **$5M** | $100K/yr | ~$85K/yr* | 20–30 | $100K–$250K | $100K |

*After fund admin, legal, and operating costs (~$15K–$25K/yr for small funds)

### The Honest Assessment

**$1M Fund:**
- ❌ Management fees don't cover living costs
- ❌ Too few investments for diversification
- ❌ Not taken seriously by most LPs
- ✅ Forces extreme discipline
- ✅ Proof of concept for Fund II
- **Verdict:** Only if you have another income source. Think of it as a "proof of concept" fund.

**$2M Fund:**
- ⚠️ Management fees are tight (~$34K/yr after costs)
- ✅ Enough for 12–15 investments (decent diversification)
- ✅ Achievable with 10–15 LPs
- ✅ Meaningful enough for LPs to take seriously
- **Verdict:** Viable minimum if you have supplemental income (consulting, teaching, freelance). This is your "Start Fund" option via VC Lab.

**$3M Fund:**
- ✅ Management fees start to be livable (~$51K/yr)
- ✅ 15–20 investments is solid portfolio construction
- ✅ You can make meaningful follow-on investments
- **Verdict:** Strong minimum target. Raise $3M, then keep the door open to $5M.

**$5M Fund:**
- ✅ Sustainable economics
- ✅ Strong portfolio construction
- ✅ Credible fund size for LP conversations
- **Verdict:** Ideal target. But don't let perfect be the enemy of good — first close at $2M–$3M, keep raising.

### Recommended Strategy: Tiered Closes

1. **First Close at $1.5M–$2M** — enough to start deploying, creates urgency
2. **Second Close at $3M–$3.5M** — expand LP base
3. **Final Close at $5M** — or wherever you land between $3M–$6M

**Key insight:** Making your first 2–3 investments is the best fundraising tool. Nothing converts an LP faster than seeing you active and picking good companies.

### The VC Lab "Start Fund" Option
- Decile Group offers a "Start Fund" mechanism for rapid deployment
- Can begin investing with as little as $1M while continuing to raise
- Eliminates the chicken-and-egg problem (can't invest without money, can't raise without investments)

## 9. Legal Basics

### The Structure

```
Ainary Ventures Fund I, LP (Delaware Limited Partnership)
    ├── GP: Ainary Ventures Management, LLC (Delaware LLC)
    │       └── Member: Florian Ziesche (100% or with co-GP)
    └── LPs: Your investors
```

### Why Delaware?
- Industry standard for venture funds
- Favorable LLC and LP law
- Extensive legal precedent
- All major fund attorneys know Delaware structures
- Courts that understand fund disputes

### Required Legal Documents

| Document | What It Is | Cost Range | Priority |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Certificate of Formation (GP LLC)** | Creates the GP entity in Delaware | $200–$500 (filing fees) | Do first |
| **LLC Operating Agreement** | Governs the GP entity (your management company) | Included in legal package | Do first |
| **Certificate of Limited Partnership** | Creates the fund entity in Delaware | $200–$500 (filing fees) | Do first |
| **Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA)** | THE key document. Governs fund terms, fees, carry, rights. LPs negotiate this. | Part of legal package | Critical |
| **Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)** | Disclosure document describing the fund, risks, strategy. Protects you legally. | Part of legal package | Critical |
| **Subscription Agreement** | How LPs actually invest — their application + commitment | Part of legal package | Critical |
| **Side Letter Template** | Special terms for specific LPs (MFN, fee discounts, co-invest rights) | Part of legal package | As needed |
| **Form D (SEC)** | Filed with SEC within 15 days of first sale under Reg D 506(b) or 506(c) | $0 (SEC filing) | Required |
| **Blue Sky Filings** | State-level notice filings where your LPs reside | $100–$500 per state | Required |

### Legal Cost Ranges

| Approach | Cost | Timeline | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| **VC Lab / Decile Group templates** | $0–$5K | 2–4 weeks | Fastest, cheapest. Uses standardized docs. |
| **Emerging manager specialist attorney** | $15K–$30K | 4–8 weeks | Balanced cost/customization |
| **Top-tier fund formation firm** (Cooley, WilsonSonsini, Goodwin) | $40K–$75K+ | 6–12 weeks | Overkill for $5M Fund I |
| **Legal-tech platforms** (AngelList, Assure, Carta) | $5K–$15K | 2–4 weeks | Streamlined, good for small funds |

### Recommended Approach for Ainary Ventures
1. **Use VC Lab templates as the base** (they're designed for this exact scenario)
2. **Have an emerging manager attorney review** ($5K–$10K for review + customization)
3. **Total legal budget: $5K–$15K**
4. **Recommended attorneys for emerging managers:**
   - Signature Block (specifically for emerging VCs)
   - Venture Fund Blueprint network
   - Ask VC Lab for their recommended attorneys

### Key Fund Terms to Decide

| Term | Standard for Fund I | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Management Fee | 2% on committed capital | Can drop to 1.5% after investment period |
| Carried Interest | 20% | Standard |
| Preferred Return (Hurdle) | 8% | European waterfall preferred by LPs |
| GP Commitment | 2–5% | Higher = more LP confidence |
| Fund Term | 10 years + 2x 1-year extensions | Standard |
| Investment Period | 3 years | When you can make new investments |
| LPAC (LP Advisory Committee) | Yes, 3–5 members | Good governance signal |
| Key Person | Yes (Florian) | Required for solo GP |
| Minimum LP Commitment | $50K–$100K | Your call — lower = more LPs but more admin |

### Regulatory Basics
- **Reg D 506(b):** Up to unlimited $ from accredited investors + up to 35 sophisticated non-accredited. **No general solicitation.** Most common for Fund I.
- **Reg D 506(c):** Accredited investors only, but **can advertise/generally solicit.** Must verify accreditation.
- **Exempt Reporting Adviser (ERA):** If under $150M AUM and only advise private funds, you don't need full SEC registration. File Form ADV.
- **Form D filing:** Within 15 days of first LP investment. Don't forget this.

## 10. VC Lab / Decile Group Leverage

### What You Get (Use ALL of It)

| Asset | How to Leverage | Priority |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Brand association** | "Launched through VC Lab, a Decile Group company that has launched 900+ VC firms" — put it in every deck, every email | 🔴 High |
| **Legal templates** | Use their fund formation docs as the base — saves $20K–$50K in legal fees | 🔴 High |
| **LP introductions** | Decile has relationships with LPs who specifically back emerging managers. Ask for warm intros. | 🔴 High |
| **Peer network** | 900+ fund managers = deal flow, co-invest, referrals, LP referrals | 🔴 High |
| **Start Fund mechanism** | Begin deploying before full raise is complete | 🟡 Medium |
| **Decile Hub** | Platform for fund operations, reporting, LP management | 🟡 Medium |
| **Content/thought leadership** | Get featured in VC Lab blog, case studies, events. Social proof. | 🟡 Medium |
| **Mentors/advisors** | VC Lab alumni who've raised successfully. Learn from them. | 🔴 High |
| **Demo Day / LP showcase** | If available — direct exposure to qualified LPs | 🔴 High |
| **Emerging manager program connections** | VC Lab can connect you to institutional EM programs | 🟡 Medium |

### Specific Plays

**Play 1: The VC Lab Social Proof Stack**
- Add "VC Lab Cohort [X] | Decile Group" to your LinkedIn headline
- Mention it in the first paragraph of every LP email
- Include the VC Lab logo on your pitch deck
- Reference the "900+ VC firms launched" stat

**Play 2: The Cohort Network**
- Map every cohort member's LP base
- Identify 3–5 who have similar LP targets → share leads
- Offer co-invest on each other's deals → strengthens both portfolios
- Attend every VC Lab event, mixer, and LP showcase

**Play 3: Alumni Leverage**
- Identify 5–10 VC Lab alumni who raised $5M+ for Fund I
- Reach out: "How did you close your first 5 LPs?"
- Ask for LP referrals: "Any LPs who loved backing emerging managers through VC Lab?"
- Ask to be included in their LP updates as a "VC Lab Fund to Watch"

**Play 4: The Decile LP Channel**
- Ask your VC Lab lead about Decile's LP matching
- Some LPs specifically allocate to VC Lab funds
- Position yourself as a top performer in the cohort (engagement, progress, thesis clarity)

## 11. The "First 5 LPs" Strategy

### Why the First 5 Matter More Than the Next 20

Your first 5 LPs determine everything:
- **Social proof** — every subsequent LP will ask "who else is in?"
- **Reference checks** — LPs call other LPs
- **Momentum** — first close enables deployment, which enables more fundraising
- **Confidence** — your own conviction skyrockets after the first commitments

### The Concentric Circles Model

```
Ring 1: CLOSEST (LP #1–2)
├── Someone who'd invest in YOU as a person
├── Doesn't need the full thesis pitch
├── Friends, family, former co-founders, close advisors
├── Target: $50K–$200K each
└── Approach: Direct conversation, not email

Ring 2: PROFESSIONAL TRUST (LP #3–4)
├── People who've seen you work
├── Former colleagues, bosses, investors in your previous startup
├── Angels who've co-invested with you
├── Target: $50K–$250K each
└── Approach: Warm email + 30-min meeting + deck

Ring 3: THESIS BELIEVERS (LP #5+)
├── People who believe in the AI-B2B thesis
├── May not know you personally but resonate with the strategy
├── Operators, family offices, VC Lab network
├── Target: $100K–$500K each
└── Approach: Intro from Ring 1/2 LP + full pitch

```

### Exact Playbook for LP #1

**Who:** Your single closest, most trusted person with capital. Someone who would bet on YOU.

**Timeline:** This month.

**Approach:**
1. Call them (not email). Say: "I'm building something and I want you to be the first to hear about it."
2. Meet in person if possible. Coffee, dinner, walk.
3. Don't pitch. Tell your story: why you're doing this, what you've seen, why now.
4. Share the vision: "I'm raising $5M to invest in AI-native B2B startups."
5. Be direct: "I'd love you to be my first LP. $[amount]. It would mean a lot."
6. Handle objections with honesty, not sales tactics.
7. If they say yes: get the commitment in writing within 48 hours.
8. If they say "let me think": give them 1 week, then follow up.

### The "First 5 LPs" Roster (Fill This In)

| # | Name | Relationship | Why Them | Est. Check | Status |
|---|------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | _____________ | _____________ | _____________ | $_______ | Not yet contacted |

### Who NOT to Approach First
- ❌ Institutional LPs (waste of time for first close)
- ❌ People who'll ask for a discount/special terms before committing
- ❌ People who'll take 6 months to decide
- ❌ People who need to "check with their advisor" (unless the advisor is pre-sold)
- ❌ Anyone you'd feel weird asking for money

## 12. Follow-up Cadence

### The System

Most LP commitments happen between touch 3 and touch 7. **Only 2% commit after the first meeting.** Follow-up is where deals close.

### The Cadence

```
Day 0:     Initial meeting / pitch
Day 1:     Thank-you email + deck + one-pager (same day or next morning)
Day 5:     "Checking in" email — reference something specific from the conversation
Day 14:    Value-add touch — share relevant article, deal, or insight
Day 21:    Direct ask: "Have you had a chance to review? Happy to answer any questions."
Day 30:    Update touch: "Quick update — we've [hit milestone/made investment/added LP]."
Day 45:    Soft close: "We're approaching [close date]. I'd love to have you involved."
Day 60:    Final push: "Last allocations before [close]. Want to make sure you have the option."
Day 75+:   Move to quarterly newsletter cadence (stay warm for Fund II)
```

### Templates for Each Touch

**Day 1 — Thank You:**
```
Subject: Great speaking today — deck attached

[Name], thanks for the time today. Really appreciated your questions about [specific topic].

Attached: our pitch deck and a one-pager summary. Happy to answer anything that comes up.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Florian
```

**Day 5 — Check-In:**
```
Subject: Re: Great speaking today — deck attached

Hi [Name], wanted to follow up on our conversation about [specific topic they raised]. I've been thinking about your question on [X] — here's my take: [brief, thoughtful answer].

Let me know if anything else comes up as you review the materials.

Florian
```

**Day 14 — Value Add:**
```
Subject: Thought of you — [relevant article/insight]

[Name], saw this and thought of our conversation: [link or brief summary].

This is exactly the kind of trend driving our thesis. Happy to discuss further anytime.

Florian
```

**Day 21 — Direct Ask:**
```
Subject: Checking in on Ainary Ventures

Hi [Name], wanted to check in — have you had a chance to review the deck?

Happy to jump on a quick call to walk through any questions. We're making good progress toward our first close, and I'd love to have you involved.

Free this week?

Florian
```

**Day 30 — Milestone Update:**
```
Subject: Ainary Ventures update — [milestone]

Hi [Name], quick update: [we've secured $X in commitments / made our first investment / added [notable LP]].

Momentum is building and I wanted to make sure you're in the loop. Let me know if you'd like to discuss next steps.

Florian
```

### Rules of Engagement

- **NEVER** follow up more than once per week
- **ALWAYS** add value in each touch (insight, update, article — not just "checking in")
- **Read the signals:** If they say "not now," respect it. Move to quarterly cadence.
- **If they ghost after 3 follow-ups:** One final "no hard feelings" email, then quarterly newsletter
- **If they say no:** Thank them genuinely. Ask: "Is there anyone in your network who might be a fit?" (Referrals from "no's" are gold.)
- **Track everything:** CRM with dates, notes, next action. Don't trust your memory.

### The "No" Categories

| Type of No | What It Means | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| "Not right now" | Timing issue. They might mean it. | Quarterly updates. Re-approach for Fund II or next close. |
| "Too small for us" | Fund size mismatch. Legit. | Thank them. Ask for referrals to people who invest in smaller funds. |
| "We don't do first-time managers" | Policy. Unlikely to change. | Note for Fund II. Ask what they'd need to see. |
| "Let me think about it" (×3) | Soft no. They won't commit. | One more try with a deadline, then move on. |
| "I need to check with..." | Decision isn't theirs alone. | Ask: "Can I present to your [partner/advisor/committee] directly?" |
| Ghosting | They're not interested but can't say no. | Two more touches, then quarterly. |

## 13. Common Objections + Responses

### Objection 1: "You're a first-time fund manager"

**Response:**
> "You're right — this is my first fund. But I'm not a first-time investor or first-time builder. I've raised €5.5M+ as a founder, built AI products deployed in production, and evaluated hundreds of startups. The data backs first-time managers: Cambridge Associates shows Fund I and Fund II managers consistently appear in the top-performing decile. First-time managers outperform because we're hungry, focused, and don't have the 'portfolio overhang' that established funds carry. I'm building this fund the same way I built my company — with discipline, technical depth, and obsessive founder focus."

### Objection 2: "No track record / No exits"

**Response:**
> "Fair question. Here's how I think about track record for a pre-seed/seed fund: the best predictor of success isn't past exits — it's judgment about founders and technology. My 'track record' is 10+ years of building AI products, identifying what works vs. what's hype, and sitting in the founder's seat. I can share [X angel investments / advisory roles / co-investments] as proof points. But honestly, every great fund manager started with Fund I. The question is: do you believe in the thesis and the person? I'm happy to provide references from founders, co-investors, and people who've seen me work."

### Objection 3: "The fund is too small"

**Response:**
> "At $5M, we're deliberately small — and that's the strategy, not a limitation. Small funds have structural advantages at pre-seed/seed: we can invest in oversubscribed rounds where $100M funds are excluded. We can back 20–30 companies at $100K–$250K each, getting meaningful ownership at the earliest stage. And our economics are aligned: I only make real money through carry, not management fees. A $5M fund returning 5x is $25M — that's a great outcome for everyone. We're not trying to be Andreessen Horowitz. We're trying to be the best seed fund for AI-native B2B founders."

### Objection 4: "I don't invest in venture / too risky"

**Response:**
> "I understand the risk perception. But here's the reframe: not having exposure to AI is arguably the bigger risk in 2026. This isn't crypto speculation — AI-native B2B companies have real customers, real revenue, and solve real operational problems. Our fund diversifies across 20–30 companies, and the pre-seed/seed entry point means valuations are rational. The question isn't 'is VC risky?' — it's 'do you want exposure to the most transformative technology shift since the internet, at the earliest and most favorable entry point?'"

### Objection 5: "What makes you different from 1,000 other AI funds?"

**Response:**
> "Three things most AI funds can't claim: (1) I've actually built AI products in production — not evaluated them from a pitch deck, BUILT them. I can assess technical architecture, model quality, and engineering talent at a level that career VCs cannot. (2) Dual US/EU access — I source deals from NYC AND from the German/European manufacturing ecosystem, which is an untapped gold mine for applied AI. (3) Pre-seed focus — most 'AI funds' are writing $5M–$20M checks at Series A. We're the first money in, at the best valuations, for founders who need an investor who speaks their technical language."

### Objection 6: "I need to see a few investments first"

**Response:**
> "Completely fair. Here's what I'd suggest: let me add you to our LP update list. You'll see our deal flow, investment decisions, and portfolio progress in real time. When you see us in action, you can decide. Many of our best LPs start by watching, then commit to the next close or Fund II. I'd rather have a convicted LP than a pressured one. But I'll be transparent: first close LPs get the best terms and the earliest exposure."

### Objection 7: "I know someone at [big VC firm], why not just invest there?"

**Response:**
> "Great question. Large funds and small funds serve completely different purposes in a portfolio. A large fund gives you brand-name exposure but often at higher valuations and with diluted returns — when a $500M fund returns 3x, that's good but not life-changing for any single LP. A $5M seed fund returning 5–10x is a fundamentally different return profile. We're also seeing deals that Tier 1 funds never see — these companies are too early, too niche, or too technical for brand-name VCs. We're complementary, not competitive."

### Objection 8: "Your management fees don't cover a real team"

**Response:**
> "By design. At $5M, the management fee covers my time and minimal operations — and that's the point. I'm not building an empire; I'm building a portfolio. My incentive is entirely aligned with yours through carry. I'm lean, I'm fast, and I don't have the overhead that eats into larger fund returns. Solo GP funds at this size consistently outperform because every dollar goes to investments, not salaries for analysts who add slides to decks."

### Objection 9: "The LP minimum is too high / too low"

**Response (too high):**
> "I hear you. For people I have strong conviction in as long-term partners, I'm willing to discuss a lower entry point. What matters to me is having the right people around the table, not just the right numbers."

**Response (too low):**
> "We keep the minimum accessible because the best LPs for a Fund I aren't always the wealthiest — they're the most connected, most knowledgeable, and most supportive. A $50K LP who introduces us to 3 deals is more valuable than a $500K LP who never returns our calls."

### Objection 10: "Why should I invest in a VC fund when I can just invest in AI stocks?"

**Response:**
> "Public AI stocks (NVIDIA, Microsoft, etc.) are already priced for AI's success. You're buying at 30–50x revenue. Pre-seed/seed venture is the opposite: you're buying at the ground floor, at valuations of $2M–$10M, in companies that could become the next generation of AI infrastructure. The risk/return profile is fundamentally different. And you get access to companies that won't be public for 7–10 years — by the time they IPO, the 100x return opportunity is gone."

## Final Notes

### The 3 Rules of Fund I Fundraising

1. **Fundraise from strength, not desperation.** If you're building, deploying, and sharing insights — LPs come to you. If you're just "raising" — they smell it.

2. **Your first 5 LPs are your marketing team.** Treat them like co-founders. Update them weekly. Make them feel like insiders. They'll sell the fund for you.

3. **Every "no" is data.** Track why. Adjust. The pitch that closes LP #15 won't be the pitch you started with. Iterate like a founder.

### What To Do Monday Morning

- [ ] Fill in the "First 5 LPs" roster above
- [ ] Complete VC Lab Sprint steps 6, 7, 8
- [ ] Draft your one-pager (use template in Appendix B)
- [ ] Start your LP pipeline tracker (Appendix A)
- [ ] Identify your LP #1 and call them this week
