# Content Trends 2026: Research Report
## AI/VC/Tech Content Strategy for Florian Ziesche

**Research Completed:** February 7, 2026  
**Focus:** What's working in AI/VC/tech content (Feb 2026)

---

## Executive Summary

The content landscape in early 2026 is defined by a paradox: **AI has flooded the internet with generic content, making authentic human voice more valuable than ever.** 90% of online content is predicted to be AI-generated by end of 2026, which means differentiation now comes from personality, vulnerability, and real expertise—not polish.

**Key insight for Florian:** The sweet spot is using AI for structure/speed while injecting your operator experience, contrarian takes, and "how I" stories. Generic "how to" content is dead. Personal, opinionated, data-backed content wins.

---

## 🎯 Top 10 Content Trends for 2026

### 1. **"Build in Public" is a Growth Magnet**
**What:** Real-time documentation of your journey—wins, failures, revenue, lessons.

**Why it works:**
- Creates parasocial connection
- Shows vulnerability = trust
- Gives people a reason to follow long-term
- Turns lurkers into fans

**Platform fit:**
- LinkedIn: Weekly updates with metrics (Day 1 of..., Week 4 progress)
- Twitter/X: Daily micro-updates, threaded learnings
- Substack: Monthly deep-dive reflections

**Example:**
A creator building a LinkedIn ghostwriting agency shares weekly revenue + lessons → attracts leads from those watching the process.

**For Florian:**
- Document your VC job search journey (applications, rejections, learnings)
- Share consulting funnel metrics (lead → proposal → closed)
- Build Ainary Ventures thesis in public (research notes, portfolio logic)

---

### 2. **First-Person "How I" Stories > Generic "How To" Guides**
**What:** Personal experience narratives that teach through story, not instruction.

**The shift:**
- "How to raise VC" = AI can write this → boring
- "How I landed meetings with 12 VCs in 3 weeks" = only you can write this → valuable

**Why it works:**
- Can't be replicated by AI or competitors
- Shows proof, not theory
- More relatable and memorable
- Builds personal brand authority

**Example:**
"Being a mom taught me time management better than any MBA" → then links to how she runs client projects.

**For Florian:**
- "How I got 12 VC interviews without a traditional finance background"
- "How I scaled a legal AI product from 0 to $X MRR"
- "How I built a consulting funnel that books 8 calls/week"

---

### 3. **Short, Punchy Text Posts Dominate LinkedIn**
**What:** Sub-100-word posts with strong hooks that stop the scroll.

**Format:**
```
Quit the job.
Lost the title.
Found freedom.

[2-3 lines expanding the point]
```

**Why it works:**
- People scroll fast
- Emotional hooks get reads
- Easy to engage (like/comment)
- Algorithm favors quick engagement

**Platform-specific:**
- LinkedIn: 3-7 line posts with line breaks
- Twitter/X: Single tweets often outperform threads now
- Mix with longer deep-dives (80/20 rule: 80% short, 20% long)

**Anti-pattern:** Long, dense paragraphs without hooks = invisible.

---

### 4. **Native Carousels Still Crush on LinkedIn**
**What:** LinkedIn document posts (PDFs) with 5-10 slides.

**Why it works:**
- Maximizes "dwell time" (key LinkedIn metric)
- More swipes = more exposure
- Highly saveable content
- Shows expertise visually

**Format:**
- Slide 1: Attention-grabbing title
- Slides 2-9: One insight per slide
- Slide 10: CTA (follow, DM, link)

**Example:**
"7 Mistakes People Make in LinkedIn Outreach" → each slide = 1 mistake + fix.

**For Florian:**
- "10 Lessons from 100 VC Applications"
- "The AI Content Playbook: 8 Formats That Work in 2026"
- "How to Build a $10K/Month Consulting Business"

**Tool rec:** Canva, Figma, or even Google Slides → export as PDF.

---

### 5. **Data-Driven Content Performs Exceptionally**
**What:** Charts, graphs, screenshots, frameworks backed by real numbers.

**Why it works:**
- Perceived as more valuable
- Gets shared and saved more
- Cuts through generic fluff
- Establishes credibility

**Format:**
- "We tested 3 LinkedIn CTAs. Here's the conversion data across 200K impressions."
- "I analyzed 50 top VC posts. Here's what they all had in common."

**For Florian:**
- Track your own content performance → share meta-insights
- Analyze VC funding data → unique angles on market trends
- Share consulting conversion rates (lead → call → client)

**Anti-pattern:** Just stating opinions without data = low trust in 2026.

---

### 6. **Substack Notes > Long Posts for Growth**
**What:** Short-form feed content on Substack (like Twitter inside the platform).

**Why it works:**
- Substack is heavily promoting Notes
- 20-30 min/day = consistent growth
- Easier to batch than long posts
- Algorithm favors daily presence

**Strategy:**
- Write Notes daily (insights, questions, micro-stories)
- Write long posts 1-2×/week
- Use Notes to promote long posts
- Most new subscribers come from Notes, not newsletters

**For Florian:**
- Daily Notes: VC insights, AI observations, lessons learned
- Weekly long post: Deep-dive analysis or story
- Cross-promote: "Wrote about this in today's newsletter →"

**Source:** Multiple Substack creators report 60-80% of growth now comes from Notes, not email posts.

---

### 7. **Multi-Platform Cross-Pollination is Essential**
**What:** Can't rely on one platform's algorithm—need external traffic funnels.

**The shift:**
- 2024: Grow organically on one platform
- 2026: Build flywheels between platforms

**Why:**
- Platform growth is harder (more competition, algorithm changes)
- Top creators bring external traffic (LinkedIn → Substack, Twitter → Newsletter)
- Diversification = protection against platform changes

**Winning combinations:**
- LinkedIn + Substack (professional audience)
- Twitter + Newsletter (tech/VC audience)
- HN + Personal blog (developer audience)

**For Florian:**
- LinkedIn (authority building) → Substack (deeper content)
- Twitter (quick takes) → Blog (long-form)
- HN submissions → Drive blog traffic

**Tactic:** Every Substack post gets a LinkedIn summary post with link. Every Twitter thread becomes a blog post.

---

### 8. **Commenting as Growth Strategy**
**What:** Thoughtful comments on viral posts = profile views and follows without creating content.

**Why it works:**
- Piggyback on others' reach
- Show expertise without writing full post
- Lower effort, high ROI
- "Top Comment" badges = algorithmic boost

**How:**
- Find posts with 500+ reactions (early, rising)
- Add genuine insight (not just "great post!")
- Include personal experience or data
- Do this 3-5×/day

**Example:**
Under viral post about AI: "Totally agree. We improved our pipeline velocity by focusing on intent data, cutting waste in half." → Gains 100+ followers without posting.

**For Florian:**
- Comment on top VC posts (Brad Feld, Sarah Tavel, etc.)
- Engage in AI/tech discussions
- Share operator perspective in startup threads

---

### 9. **Authenticity Over Polish (Anti-AI)**
**What:** Imperfect, human writing beats AI-polished content.

**The problem:**
- 90% of content will be AI-generated by late 2026
- AI creates safe, predictable, boring writing
- Audiences crave real voices with personality

**Tell-tale AI signs people hate:**
- "In today's world..."
- "More than ever..."
- Em dash "—" everywhere
- Perfect structure, no personality

**How to stand out:**
- Share real stories (vulnerable, messy)
- Use contrarian takes
- Inject humor, emotion, quirks
- Mix sentence lengths (AI loves balanced sentences)
- Include mistakes, doubts, questions

**For Florian:**
- Use AI for structure/ideation
- Rewrite in your voice with operator perspective
- Include real numbers, real stories, real opinions
- Don't sound like a generic "AI thought leader"

**Remember:** 71% of readers prefer human voices over bots (PWC study).

---

### 10. **Collaboration Accelerates Growth**
**What:** Guest posts, co-authored content, interviews, joint newsletters.

**Why it works:**
- Tap into another creator's audience
- Cross-pollination of credibility
- Faster growth than solo
- Algorithm often favors collaborative content

**Formats:**
- Guest posts (swap audiences)
- Joint carousels ("We ghostwrite for 50+ CEOs. Here are 5 mistakes...")
- Podcast interviews
- LinkedIn Lives
- Co-authored reports or guides

**For Florian:**
- Interview VCs for your newsletter
- Guest post on established AI/VC newsletters
- Co-create content with other consultants
- Joint webinars or workshops

**Source:** Substack collaborations are increasingly common among top creators.

---

## 📊 Platform-Specific Strategies

### **LinkedIn**

**What's working:**
- Short text posts (3-7 lines) with punchy hooks
- Native carousels (5-10 slides)
- Data-driven insights
- First-person stories
- Build-in-public updates
- Strong commenting game

**Frequency:** 3-5×/week (or daily short posts + 2-3 carousels/week)

**Engagement tactics:**
- Line breaks for readability
- Emojis to highlight key points
- Questions in captions
- Early comments (first hour matters)
- Tag relevant people sparingly

**Monetization path:**
- Build authority → DMs → consulting calls → clients
- Newsletter signup CTA in featured section
- LinkedIn Newsletter feature for owned audience

**Anti-patterns:**
- External links (algorithm punishes)
- Generic motivational content
- Overly promotional posts
- No hook in first 2 lines

---

### **Substack**

**What's working:**
- Notes (daily short-form) > long posts for growth
- Multimedia (video, podcasts, Lives)
- Community-building (Chat, threads, cohorts)
- Collaboration (guest posts, joint newsletters)
- Personal, vulnerable storytelling

**Frequency:**
- Notes: Daily (20-30 min)
- Long posts: 1-2×/week
- Lives/podcasts: Optional but growing

**Growth strategy:**
- Cross-platform traffic (LinkedIn, Twitter → Substack)
- Substack Recommendations network
- SEO hero posts (evergreen, rankable)
- Community engagement (reply to every comment for a week)

**Monetization:**
- Paid subscriptions (but only 2-3% conversion)
- Diversify: digital products, cohorts, consulting
- Use Substack as top-of-funnel, monetize elsewhere

**Algorithm insights:**
- Favors consistent posting
- Pushes multimedia content
- Rewards engagement (opens, likes, comments)
- Notes get more distribution than email posts

**Anti-patterns:**
- Only relying on Substack growth (bring external traffic!)
- No email list backup (export regularly)
- Ignoring Notes feature
- Purely promotional content

---

### **Twitter/X**

**What's working (2026 shifts):**
- Single tweets often > threads now
- Punchy one-liners with personality
- Quote tweets with hot takes
- Engaging in replies (visibility)
- Threads still work if valuable

**Engagement pattern:**
- Short tweets get faster engagement
- Threads require more investment from readers
- Mix both: 70% single tweets, 30% threads

**For Florian:**
- Single tweets: Quick AI/VC insights
- Threads: Deep-dives on specific topics
- Quote tweets: React to industry news with take
- Engage heavily in replies (show up consistently)

**Monetization:**
- Build following → funnel to newsletter/consulting
- Twitter Blue benefits (longer posts, better reach)

**Note:** Data limited due to platform changes, but anecdotal evidence suggests shorter format resurgence.

---

### **Hacker News**

**What makes the front page:**
- 45% blog posts (personal blogs > corporate)
- 25% personal blog posts from engineers/OSS
- Only 8% corporate blog posts make it
- 36% news articles (often non-software topics)
- ShowHN almost never makes front page (<2%)

**What works:**
- Technical depth, not marketing
- Personal projects ("I built X")
- Non-promotional tutorials
- Interesting stories (how systems work)
- Established sites (not TechCrunch—HN hates them)

**What doesn't work:**
- Product launches (~4% success rate)
- Promotional content
- Anything from TechCrunch
- Generic startup advice

**For Florian:**
- Write deep technical content (AI architecture, VC analysis)
- Share personal projects with code/data
- Tutorial-style posts (non-promotional)
- Submit via community (not self-post) if possible

**Examples that made HN front page:**
- "You could have invented Futexes"
- "Use Gröbner Bases To Solve Polynomial Equations"
- "How database sharding works" (tutorial)

**Key:** HN values intellectual curiosity over self-promotion.

---

### **Personal Blog (à la Simon Willison)**

**What works:**
- Consistent posting (almost daily)
- Deep technical dives
- "Today I Learned" style posts
- Building in public (sharing learnings)
- SEO benefits from consistency
- Owned platform (no algorithm risk)

**Format:**
- Mix of long deep-dives and short TILs
- Code snippets, screenshots, data
- Personal voice, not corporate
- Interlink posts (SEO + reader journey)

**For Florian:**
- Own domain blog for long-form, technical content
- Daily/weekly cadence
- Topics: AI, VC analysis, operator lessons
- Cross-post to Substack or link from there

**Monetization:**
- Consulting funnel
- Speaking opportunities
- Newsletter signups

**Simon Willison's moat:**
- Extreme consistency
- Deep technical expertise
- Personal voice
- Builds in public

---

## 💰 Monetization Models That Work in 2026

### **1. Multi-Stream Ecosystem (Recommended)**

**Structure:**
- **Free content** (LinkedIn, Twitter, blog) → build audience
- **Newsletter** (Substack free tier) → nurture relationship
- **Paid tier** (Substack premium) → 2-3% convert ($5-50/month)
- **Digital products** (Gumroad, Stan Store) → courses, templates
- **Cohorts/masterclasses** → $200-2,000 tickets
- **Consulting** → $200-500/hour
- **Speaking** → $2K-10K+ per event

**Why it works:**
- Not dependent on one revenue stream
- Multiple entry points (free → paid ladder)
- Substack paid conversion is low (2-3%), need other income
- Community + expertise = premium pricing power

**Example:**
- Tim Denning: Uses Substack to funnel to writing business
- Veronica Llorca: Paid subs + digital course + coaching + speaking
- Derek Hughes: Newsletter → cohorts and masterclasses

**For Florian:**
- Free: LinkedIn + blog + Substack free
- Paid newsletter: $10/month tier (low expectation)
- Digital products: VC job search playbook, AI content templates
- Cohorts: "Land a VC Job in 90 Days" ($500-1,000)
- Consulting: Fractional VC advisory, AI strategy
- Speaking: AI/VC topics at conferences

---

### **2. Community-First Model**

**Structure:**
- Build tight-knit community (Substack Chat, Discord, Skool)
- Offer premium community access ($20-100/month)
- Monetize through community programming (AMAs, workshops, networking)

**Why it works:**
- Higher retention than passive content
- People pay for access to people, not just content
- Creates network effects

**Example:**
- Michael Lim: Uses Substack as gateway → Skool community
- Katja Groesser: Weekly group coaching for paid subscribers

**For Florian:**
- Build "VC Job Hunters" community
- Or "AI Operators" community
- Weekly group calls, job board, intro network

---

### **3. Consulting Funnel**

**Structure:**
- Content demonstrates expertise
- CTA: Book a free 30-min call
- Discovery call → paid engagement

**Why it works:**
- High-ticket services ($5K-50K+ projects)
- Content pre-qualifies leads
- Scales with reputation

**For Florian:**
- AI strategy consulting for startups
- Fundraising advisory
- Fractional VC work
- Legal tech product consulting

**Content → Consulting playbook:**
1. Publish high-value content (case studies, frameworks)
2. Build credibility (data, results, stories)
3. Make it easy to book a call (Calendly link everywhere)
4. Discovery call → scope → proposal → close

---

### **4. Product-Led Growth**

**Structure:**
- Create digital product (course, template, playbook)
- Content drives traffic to product sales page
- Automated sales (no calls needed)

**Why it works:**
- Scalable (time investment upfront, passive income after)
- Lower price point ($50-500) = easier conversions
- Can be evergreen

**Example:**
- "Substack Growth Masterclass" ($97)
- "AI Content Playbook" ($47)
- "VC Application Template Pack" ($29)

**For Florian:**
- "The VC Job Application Playbook" (templates, scripts, strategies)
- "AI Content Engine" (prompts, workflows, examples)
- "Fundraising Deck Teardown" (video course)

---

## 📅 Content Frequency Recommendations

### **High-frequency (Daily):**
- LinkedIn comments: 5-10/day
- Substack Notes: 1-2/day
- Twitter: 2-5 tweets/day
- Reading/research: 30-60 min/day

**Time:** 60-90 min/day total

---

### **Mid-frequency (3×/week):**
- LinkedIn posts: 3-5/week
  - Mix: 3 short text posts + 1-2 carousels
- Substack long posts: 1-2/week

**Time:** 2-3 hours/week

---

### **Low-frequency (Weekly):**
- Blog posts: 1/week
- Newsletter: 1/week
- Podcast/video (optional): 1/week

**Time:** 3-5 hours/week

---

### **Total time commitment:**
- Daily engagement: 60-90 min
- Content creation: 5-8 hours/week
- **Total: ~12-15 hours/week**

**Florian's context:**
- While job searching: Can do daily engagement + 3 posts/week
- Once employed: Scale back to 2-3×/week posting, maintain daily engagement
- Weekend batch: Write 2-3 posts on Sunday, schedule through week

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid (What's Dying)

### **1. Generic AI-Generated Content**
**What:** Publishing first-draft AI outputs without editing for voice/personality.

**Why it fails:** Everyone sounds the same. No differentiation. No trust.

**Fix:** Use AI for structure, rewrite with your voice + stories + data.

---

### **2. Overly Promotional Content**
**What:** Every post is "buy my thing."

**Why it fails:** Algorithm punishes, audience tunes out.

**Fix:** 90% value, 10% promotion. Sell through demonstration, not desperation.

---

### **3. Platform Dependence**
**What:** Building entire audience on one platform without backup.

**Why it fails:** Algorithm changes, account bans, platform decline.

**Fix:** 
- Export email list regularly
- Cross-platform presence
- Own your domain/blog

---

### **4. Inconsistent Posting**
**What:** Posting sporadically without rhythm.

**Why it fails:** Algorithm favors consistency. Audience forgets you.

**Fix:** Pick sustainable cadence (even if lower frequency) and stick to it.

---

### **5. No Clear CTA**
**What:** Great content, but no next step for reader.

**Why it fails:** People don't know what to do next.

**Fix:** Every post needs a CTA:
- Follow for more
- Comment with your take
- DM me "X" for Y
- Read full post here
- Book a call

---

### **6. Ignoring Platform-Native Formats**
**What:** Posting YouTube links on LinkedIn, external links everywhere.

**Why it fails:** Algorithms punish taking users off-platform.

**Fix:** 
- LinkedIn: Native video, carousels, text
- Twitter: Native threads and media
- Substack: Keep readers in-app

---

### **7. Writing for Everyone**
**What:** Trying to appeal to broad audience.

**Why it fails:** Bland content that resonates with no one.

**Fix:** Niche down. Write for specific person/use case. Attract tribe, not masses.

---

### **8. No Community Engagement**
**What:** Only broadcasting, never responding.

**Why it fails:** One-way relationship. No loyalty.

**Fix:** Reply to comments, engage with peers, build reciprocity.

---

### **9. Vanity Metrics Focus**
**What:** Obsessing over likes/followers instead of conversions.

**Why it fails:** 10K followers but 0 clients = hobby, not business.

**Fix:** Track what matters:
- Email subscribers
- Discovery calls booked
- Revenue generated
- Engagement rate (not just volume)

---

### **10. Long-Form Only (No Short-Form)**
**What:** Only writing 2,000-word essays.

**Why it fails:** Attention is fragmented. Need entry points.

**Fix:** Mix formats:
- 80% short (quick wins, engagement)
- 20% long (depth, authority)

---

### **Differentiation Strategy (Stand Out in AI/VC Space):**

**Everyone talks AI. How to stand out:**

1. **Operator + VC lens** (most are one or the other)
2. **Real data** (your own experiments, not generic stats)
3. **Technical depth** (most VC content is surface-level)
4. **Contrarian takes** (challenge conventional wisdom with evidence)
5. **Vulnerability** (share failures, not just wins)
6. **Specificity** ("How I built X" > "How to build X")

**Example topics only you can write:**
- "Why Most AI Pitches to VCs Fail (From Both Sides)"
- "I Built 2 AI Products. Here's What Actually Mattered."
- "The VC Job Search Nobody Talks About: 100 Applications, 12 Interviews, 0 Offers (Yet)"

**For Florian:**

Your edge isn't being the loudest. It's being the most **real, specific, and valuable** in your niche intersection:
- **Technical operator** who built AI products

- **Content strategist** who practices what he preaches

Build your content engine around these three pillars. Share the journey, the data, the lessons. Use AI for speed, but your voice for differentiation.

The opportunity is huge. The competition is noise. Your moat is specificity.
