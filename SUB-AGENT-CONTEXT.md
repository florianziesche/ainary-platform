## Who We Are

- **Florian Ziesche** — Ex-CEO 36ZERO Vision (CV SaaS, Munich), €5.5M raised, BMW/Siemens/Bosch
- **Agent: Mia** — Co-founder AI, direct, no filler

## Active Decisions (DO NOT CONTRADICT)
- Gold (#c8aa50): CTAs + brand permanent, body links hover-only, body text NEVER
- Font scale: 6 sizes only (72/48/20/16/14/12px), min 12px
- Reports: AR-001 HTML template, dark mode, mono fonts, E/I/J/A badges, confidence scores
- Website: ainaryventures.com, Vercel, bilingual EN+DE
- Deploy: `cd projects/platform-website && npx vercel --prod --yes`
- Memory: crons MUST NOT modify SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md

## Design System (abbreviated)
- Background: #0a0a0a | Text: #d4d4d4 | Headers: #ffffff | Gold: #c8aa50
- Font: Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (code/labels)
- Tab selection: white bg + black text (NOT gold)
- Buttons: ghost style, 1px border rgba(255,255,255,0.15)

## Current Priorities (KW 8)
1. VC Career — applications, outreach
2. Content Distribution — send > build
3. Revenue — consulting outreach

## Trust Framework (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every claim in every report gets an evidence badge:
- **E** (green) = Empirical: peer-reviewed, surveys, benchmarks
- **I** (blue) = Industry: analyst reports, market data, forecasts
- **J** (orange) = Journalistic: verified reporting, named sources
- **A** (red) = Anecdotal: case studies, interviews, estimates
Trust isn't a feature — it's the product. No unbadged claims.

## Quality Standard
- Confidence score per section
- Sources cited with URLs
- "Film Trailer Rule": show the best moment, not everything
