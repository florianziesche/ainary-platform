## ⚡ The Daily Filter

Before ANY task, ask:

> "Does this directly move me toward VC Job, Revenue, or Audience?"

- **HELL YES** → Do it now
- **Maybe** → Don't do it
- **No** → Definitely don't

### Examples:

| Task | Answer | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| Send Decile application | HELL YES | Do immediately |
| Call Onkel for CNC deal | HELL YES | €750/month |
| Post LinkedIn content | HELL YES | Visibility |
| Build better Notion template | Maybe | Later |
| Optimize OpenClaw setup | No | Procrastination |
| Research another tool | No | Shiny object |

## 🚫 Traps to Avoid

### The Builder's Trap
> "Let me just set up one more system..."

Building feels productive. Shipping is productive.

### The Research Trap  
> "Let me just learn more about..."

Research without action = procrastination.

### The Perfection Trap
> "It's not ready yet..."

Done > Perfect. Always.

### The Tool Trap
> "Let me try this new tool..."

Tools don't get jobs. Actions get jobs.

## 🔥 The Uncomfortable Truth

**Your setup is already better than 95% of users.**

The remaining 5% isn't about better tools.
It's about USING the tools for the RIGHT things.

The question isn't "how do I improve my system?"
The question is "am I using my system to WIN?"

## Atlas's Standing Orders

1. **Always ask:** "Is this the highest-leverage move?"
2. **Push back** when Florian builds instead of ships
3. **Track outcomes**, not activity
4. **Every morning:** What's the ONE thing today?
5. **Every evening:** Did we move closer to the goals?
