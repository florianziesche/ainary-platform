## POST 1: Sarah Guo's "Software Abundance" (VC Audience)

**Theme:** Disagreeing with Sarah Guo = thought leadership  
**Hook:** Contrarian take on AI abundance  
**Length:** ~1100 chars

```
Sarah Guo's "Software Abundance" post argues that AI will make software so cheap that the entire economic structure shifts.

I disagree — here's why:

Abundance doesn't destroy value. It concentrates it.

When content became abundant (YouTube, social media), we got... the Creator Economy. When storage became free, we got... cloud infrastructure giants.

The pattern: Abundance at the commodity layer → premiums at the orchestration layer.

AI will follow the same path:

• Commodity = LLM inference (already racing to zero)
• Value = The orchestration layer (agents, workflows, compound systems)

The winners won't be building "yet another wrapper." They'll be building the Operating System for AI work.

Think about it:
• Search became free → Google dominates by orchestrating ALL the information
• Compute became cheap → AWS/Azure dominate by orchestrating infrastructure
• AI inference is getting free → ??? will dominate by orchestrating agents

The question isn't "can AI do X?" anymore. It's "who builds the system that makes AI reliably do X at scale?"

That's where I'm investing my time — both as a builder and as I transition into VC.

What do you think? Does abundance destroy value or concentrate it?

- Engages with Sarah Guo (Conviction = top AI fund)
- Shows contrarian thinking
- Positions Florian as systems thinker
- Relevant to VCs hiring

## POST 2: The CNC Planner Story (Revenue + Product)

**Theme:** Building in public, B2B AI  
**Hook:** Real customer outcome  
**Length:** ~950 chars

```
"30 minutes per calculation → 2 minutes."

That's what a CNC manufacturer told me yesterday after demoing the tool I built.

10+ hours saved per week. €15,000+ annual value from automating a process they didn't even realize was automatable.

Here's the thing about B2B AI that nobody talks about:

The biggest opportunities aren't in disrupting trillion-dollar industries.

They're in automating the $50,000/year problems that 10,000 businesses have.

CNC Planner automates manufacturing calculations — not sexy, but:
• €149/month price point
• 10-hour weekly time savings
• Pays for itself in 3 days

This is the AI economy that VCs miss when they're hunting for the next OpenAI.

Thousands of vertical SaaS opportunities where AI turns a painful 30-minute workflow into 2 minutes.

No fundraising needed. No moats needed. Just solve a real problem better than Excel.

I built this in 3 weeks. It's already generating demos.

If you're an AI founder chasing "AGI for X," maybe look at "automate one specific painful thing really well" first.

What's the boring problem in your industry that AI could 10x?

**Why this works:**
- Proof of execution (real customer)
- Contrarian take (vertical AI > AGI hype)
- Positions Florian as builder who ships
- Generates consulting inbound

## POST 3: Founder → VC Transition (Career Story)

**Theme:** Career transition narrative  
**Hook:** Personal journey  
**Length:** ~1050 chars

```
5 years as a startup CEO.
€5.5M raised.
Dozens of pitches to VCs.

Now I'm on the other side of the table.

Here's what I learned sitting across from investors that I'm bringing into VC:

1. VCs who were never operators don't understand technical risk.

They evaluate "is the team impressive?" instead of "can this architecture scale?"

2. Most AI diligence is vibes-based.

"The demo looks good" isn't diligence. The question is: can this go from demo to production? I've built production AI systems — I know the gaps.

3. Founders want investors who've been in the trenches.

When I pitched, the best conversations were with investors who'd built companies. They asked better questions. They offered real help, not generic advice.

That's what I bring to VC:
• Technical depth to evaluate AI architectures (not just "does the demo work?")
• Operator empathy for what founders actually need
• Fundraising experience from both sides

I'm not leaving building behind — I'm building with other people's companies now.

If you're a founder or a VC in the AI space, let's connect. I want to learn from the best.

What skill from your past career became your superpower in your current one?

**Why this works:**
- Shows self-awareness
- Positions transition as upgrade, not retreat
- Appeals to both VCs (hiring) and founders (consulting)
- Authentic, not generic

## POST 4: Multi-Agent AI Systems (Technical Thought Leadership)

**Theme:** Deep technical insight  
**Hook:** Production AI reality check  
**Length:** ~1100 chars

```
"We built an AI agent!"

Cool. Does it hallucinate?

"Sometimes, but we have guardrails."

Not good enough.

Here's the reality of production AI that most demos hide:

Single-agent systems will always hallucinate. The architecture is fundamentally unreliable.

The solution isn't better prompts. It's multi-agent verification.

We built a legal AI platform with <0.2% hallucination rate. Here's how:

**Agent 1: Questioner** — breaks down the query
**Agent 2: Researcher** — retrieves relevant sources (hybrid BM25 + semantic search)
**Agent 3: Validator** — cross-checks research against sources
**Agent 4: Reporter** — synthesizes only verified information

Four agents, each with one job. Each checking the other's work.

This is how you build AI systems that enterprises will actually pay for.

The future isn't "one really smart agent." It's orchestrated teams of specialized agents with built-in verification loops.

Single-agent demos are impressive. Multi-agent systems are production-ready.

If you're building AI products, ask yourself: How are you preventing hallucinations at the architecture level, not just the prompt level?

What's your approach to AI reliability?

**Why this works:**
- Deep technical credibility
- Differentiates Florian from surface-level AI commentators
- Attracts both VCs (technical diligence) and founders (wants this problem solved)
- Specific example = proof

## POST 5: Compound Knowledge Systems (Meta + Personal Brand)

**Theme:** How Florian works (systems thinking)  
**Hook:** Behind-the-scenes workflow  
**Length:** ~1000 chars

```
How I read 100+ AI research sources daily without drowning:

I don't read them. My system does.

Here's the workflow:

1. **Capture** — RSS feeds auto-pull articles (26 sources: VCs, AI researchers, tech blogs)
2. **Filter** — AI scans for signal (ignore hype, prioritize architecture/research/data)
3. **Extract** — Key insights saved to knowledge base (Obsidian)
4. **Connect** — New insights linked to existing knowledge
5. **Compound** — Over time, patterns emerge that single articles miss

Result: I can answer "what's the current state of X?" instantly because my system continuously builds context.

This is the difference between consumption and compounding:

• Consumption = read article, forget it, repeat
• Compounding = read article, connect to 10 others, generate insight

Tools:
• blogwatcher (RSS scanning)
• Obsidian (knowledge base)
• AI agents (extraction + synthesis)

The future of knowledge work isn't "read faster." It's "build systems that compound understanding over time."

What's your knowledge compounding system?
