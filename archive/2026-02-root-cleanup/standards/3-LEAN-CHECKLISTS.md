**Minimum Process That Works — Munger's "Killer Items" Approach**

---

## Philosophy

**"The key is to have a short list of killer items." — Charlie Munger**

Based on Gawande's *Checklist Manifesto* research:
- ✅ **5-9 items** = cognitive limit (Cowan, 2001)
- ❌ <5 = too vague, misses critical steps
- ❌ >9 = cognitive overload, ignored in practice

**Goal:** Minimum checklist that prevents 90% of failures, not 100%. Perfect is the enemy of done.

---

## ✅ Checklist 1: CONTENT (Before Publishing)

Use for: Blog posts, LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, newsletters, decks

```
[ ] 1. ANSWER FIRST — Does the first sentence/paragraph contain the bottom line?

[ ] 2. ONE CLEAR TAKEAWAY — If reader remembers only 1 thing, what is it? (Write it down.)

[ ] 3. "SO WHAT?" TEST — Every claim passes: Interesting? Actionable? Durable?

[ ] 4. HOOKS THAT WORK — Opening grabs attention in <3 seconds (question, contrarian, story, number)

[ ] 5. PROOF OR CONFIDENCE — Claims sourced OR confidence-calibrated ("likely 75%" not "probably")

[ ] 6. CUT 30% — Delete anything that doesn't directly support the main point

[ ] 7. ACTIONABLE END — Ends with clear next step or call-to-action (not "Interesting, right?")
```

**Pause point:** After draft, before publish.

**Time:** 2-3 minutes to run through.

---

## ✅ Checklist 2: OUTREACH (Before Sending)

Use for: Cold emails, LinkedIn DMs, job applications, client proposals, networking

```
[ ] 1. SUBJECT/HOOK PERSONALIZED — Mentions them specifically (not "Hi, I'm reaching out...")

[ ] 2. VALUE FIRST — Leads with what's in it for THEM (not your resume/credentials)

[ ] 3. ONE CLEAR ASK — Single, specific request (<10 words: "15-min call Tuesday?")

[ ] 4. PROOF OF RELEVANCE — Shows you did homework (mention their work, mutual connection, specific insight)

[ ] 5. BREVITY — Under 150 words total (ruthlessly cut fluff)

[ ] 6. LOW-FRICTION RESPONSE — Easy to say yes (link to calendar, pre-written reply options)

[ ] 7. TYPO CHECK — Zero typos (run spellcheck + read out loud once)
```

**Pause point:** After draft, before send.

**Time:** 1-2 minutes.

---

## ✅ Checklist 3: DELIVERABLE (Before Handing Off)

Use for: Research briefs, analysis, decks, reports, recommendations to Florian or clients

```
[ ] 1. BLUF FORMAT — Bottom line up front (answer in first 2-3 sentences)

[ ] 2. DECISION-ENABLED — Clear what the recipient should DO with this (stated explicitly)

[ ] 3. CONFIDENCE CALIBRATED — Used exact phrases (almost certainly/likely/possibly/unlikely/unknown)

[ ] 4. SOURCES CITED — Important claims have [Source: Type] or [Data: Link]

[ ] 5. GAPS FLAGGED — Explicitly stated what's missing, uncertain, or out-of-scope

[ ] 6. "WOULD THEY USE THIS AS-IS?" — Honest test: Can they copy-paste or act immediately?

[ ] 7. PRE-MORTEM IF HIGH-STAKES — Listed 2-3 ways this could be wrong (if decision >€1K or >10 hours)
```

**Pause point:** After completion, before delivery.

**Time:** 2-4 minutes.

## How to Use These Checklists

### ✅ DO:
- **Print them** — Physical checklist > mental note
- **Run at pause points** — AFTER draft, BEFORE publish/send/deliver
- **Check boxes** — Literally. Checkbox = commitment device.
- **Time yourself** — Should take <5 min per checklist
- **Iterate based on failures** — If something fails, was it on the checklist? If not, add it.

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Add more items** — If it's not in the top 5-9, it's not critical
- **Skip because "I know this"** — Checklist exists BECAUSE you forget under pressure
- **Use for trivial outputs** — Quick Slack message ≠ checklist-worthy
- **Run mid-draft** — Breaks flow; checklists are for QA, not creation

---

## When to Use Which Checklist

| Output Type | Checklist | Examples |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Written content** | CONTENT | Blog, LinkedIn, Twitter, newsletter |
| **Direct communication** | OUTREACH | Emails, DMs, intros, proposals |
| **Analysis/Research** | DELIVERABLE | Research briefs, recommendations, reports |
| **Pitch/Deck** | CONTENT + DELIVERABLE | Combine both (content for slides, deliverable for logic) |
| **Code/Product** | None yet | Build separate if needed |

---

## Checklist Maintenance

**Review monthly:**
- Which items caught actual errors?
- Which items are ignored? (Remove them.)
- What failures happened that checklist didn't catch? (Add them.)

**Target:**
- Each item should catch ≥1 error per month
- If an item NEVER catches anything → remove it (clutter)

**Principle:** Checklist should evolve based on YOUR failure modes, not generic advice.

## Examples: Before/After

### Example 1: Content Checklist Applied

**BEFORE (fails checklist):**
```
The venture capital landscape has been evolving significantly over the past few years. With rising interest rates and economic uncertainty, many funds have adjusted their strategies. This has implications for founders seeking funding, as well as for job seekers looking to break into the industry. In this post, I want to explore some of the trends I've been noticing and share my thoughts on what might be coming next...
```

❌ Fails: #1 (no answer first), #2 (unclear takeaway), #4 (boring opening), #7 (no CTA)

**AFTER (passes checklist):**
```
Don't apply to VC funds that raised in 2021—they're in zombie mode.

Why? Overfunded portfolios + poor markups = no new capital to deploy = hiring freezes through 2026. Instead, target funds that raised 2023+ (likely 80% based on AngelList job postings + partner interviews).

Your move: Filter by fund vintage on Pitchbook, prioritize 2023+ only.
```

### Example 2: Outreach Checklist Applied

**BEFORE (fails checklist):**
```
Subject: Introduction

Hi,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Florian Ziesche and I'm currently exploring opportunities in venture capital. I have a strong background in operations and have been following your fund's work for some time now. I'm particularly interested in early-stage B2B SaaS investing.

I'd love to connect and learn more about your portfolio and investment thesis. Would you be open to a conversation sometime in the coming weeks?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Florian
```

❌ Fails: #1 (generic subject), #2 (talks about himself first), #3 (vague ask), #4 (no proof of homework), #5 (too long)

**AFTER (passes checklist):**
```
Subject: Your thesis on API-first platforms (from a16z blog)

Hi [Name],

Your essay on "API-first go-to-market" nailed why Stripe/Twilio scaled faster than traditional SaaS. I built a similar motion at [Company], growing dev adoption 40% MoM by treating docs as product.

Quick ask: 15-min call to share what worked + learn how you evaluate dev-tool founders?

Calendar link: [Calendly]

Best,
Florian

### Example 3: Deliverable Checklist Applied

**BEFORE (fails checklist):**
```
I researched the VC landscape and found some interesting insights. There are several categories of funds, including generalist, sector-specific, and stage-focused. Each has different hiring patterns and requirements. Some prefer candidates with investing experience, while others value operating backgrounds. The market is competitive, but there are opportunities for the right candidate...

[3 more paragraphs of context]
```

❌ Fails: #1 (no BLUF), #2 (no decision enabled), #3 (no confidence), #6 (can't use as-is)

**AFTER (passes checklist):**
```
**ANSWER:**
Apply to 3 funds in this order: (1) Sequoia, (2) a16z, (3) Benchmark. All are hiring associates in 2026, value operator backgrounds, and match your thesis.

Confidence: Likely (75%) to respond if application is strong.

**DECISION:**
Send applications this week. Sequoia closes Feb 28; a16z rolling; Benchmark unclear.

**EVIDENCE:**
- Sequoia: LinkedIn posts (2 roles, Jan 15) [Source: LinkedIn]
- a16z: Partner interview mentioned "expanding team" [Source: TechCrunch, Jan 2026]
- Benchmark: Historical pattern (hire every 18mo, last was June 2024) [Source: Pitchbook]

**GAPS:**
- Couldn't confirm if Benchmark is hiring (no public posts)
- No data on acceptance rates for cold applications
```

✅ Passes all 7 items.

## The "Killer Items" Test

**Ask yourself:** If I ONLY checked these 5-9 items, would 90% of my failures disappear?

- If YES → You have a good checklist
- If NO → Items are wrong (replace with what actually catches errors)

**Remember:** Checklist isn't about perfection. It's about catching the dumb, preventable stuff so you can focus on the hard, creative work.

---

**Default mode:** Draft → Run checklist → Fix failures → Ship.
