## Notes
- **ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md** is from today — keep until actioned, then archive to Obsidian
- **MORNING_BRIEFING_2026-02-17.md** — archive after today
- **Website research cluster** (Feb 7): ~400K+ of research files. Consider creating `research/website-2026-02/` folder in Obsidian
- **Brand research cluster** (Feb 7): Consider `brand/` folder in Obsidian
- **VC research cluster** (Feb 4-7): Consider `vc-research/` folder in Obsidian
- The Obsidian vault currently only has HOME.md and one retrospective — plenty of room
