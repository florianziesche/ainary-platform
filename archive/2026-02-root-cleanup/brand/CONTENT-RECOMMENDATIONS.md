## CONTENT REPURPOSING SYSTEM

### The Flow:
```
Substack Article (2,500 words)
    ↓
LinkedIn Post (1,200 chars) → Excerpt + insight + CTA
    ↓
Twitter Thread (7 tweets) → Hook + key points + link
    ↓
3 Substack Notes → Bite-sized insights
    ↓
Email to list → "New article + bonus insight"
    ↓
Medium/DEV.to (optional) → SEO + reach
```

### Mia's Role:
1. Extract key insights from article
2. Draft LinkedIn post (Florian edits for voice)
3. Create Twitter thread structure
4. Write Substack Notes
5. Prepare email
6. Track performance

### Time Savings:
- **Before:** 1 article = 1 piece of content = 6 hours
- **After:** 1 article = 6 pieces of content = 7 hours total
- **Leverage:** 1x time input → 6x content output

## FINAL THOUGHT

Florian already has:
- ✅ The credentials (5 years CEO, €5.5M raised)
- ✅ The clients (BMW, Siemens, Bosch)
- ✅ The systems (100+ agents, CNC Planer)
- ✅ The story (founder → VC transition)
- ✅ The differentiation (operator + builder + VC + EU/US)

**The content strategy is simple: Document what he's already doing.**

He doesn't need to invent a brand. He needs to amplify the one he's already earned.

**Authenticity is the strategy. Distribution is the tactic.**

Ship this week. Compound from there.
