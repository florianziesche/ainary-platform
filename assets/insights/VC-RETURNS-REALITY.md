# THE VC RETURNS REALITY
## What LPs Won't Tell You and GPs Can't Admit

*The brutal truth about venture capital returns that nobody publishes because it hurts fundraising.*

---

## SECTION 1: THE RETURN ILLUSION

### The Uncomfortable Truth: Most Funds Underperform

Let's start with the number that makes every GP uncomfortable: **the median VC fund barely beats—or actively underperforms—the S&P 500**.

Here's what the data actually shows:

**25-Year Performance (Cambridge Associates, 1999-2024):**
- US VC AACR: 14.3%
- S&P 500: 7.4%
- $1,000 investment → VC: $28,408 | S&P 500: $5,991

Looks incredible, right? This is the chart every GP shows LPs. But here's what they don't show:

**10-Year Early Stage Returns (2003-2013):**
- Early Stage VC: 3.9%
- S&P 500: 8.0%

That's right—**early stage VC underperformed by more than half** during this period.

### Top Quartile vs. Bottom Quartile: The Grand Canyon

The spread between winners and losers in VC is wider than any other asset class:

**Performance Dispersion (10-Year Horizons):**
- **Top Quartile:** 15-27% IRR
- **Median:** 4-8% IRR  
- **Bottom Quartile:** -2% to +3% IRR
- **Spread:** 17-29 percentage points

In private equity, this spread is 5-12 percentage points. In public equities, it's 2-4 percentage points.

**Translation:** Getting into the wrong VC fund isn't just bad. It's catastrophic. You'd have been better off in a savings account.

Between 2013-2023, top quartile PE funds outperformed median funds by **5.2 to 12.8 percentage points**. In VC, that gap is often **15-25 percentage points**.

### Survivorship Bias: The Disappeared Funds

Here's a dirty secret: **failed VC funds stop reporting returns**.

Cambridge Associates and Preqin only track funds that:
1. Keep reporting data
2. Don't shut down completely
3. Have LPs who stay engaged

Industry estimates suggest **15-25% of VC funds effectively "disappear"** from databases:
- Stop raising follow-on funds
- Quietly wind down
- Merge into other entities
- Stop submitting data

When Horsley Bridge analyzed their actual LP returns vs. published benchmarks, they found published data **overstated returns by 1.5-3% annually** due to survivorship bias.

### IRR Manipulation: The Markup Factory

GPs have a playbook for making returns look better than they are:

**1. The Paper Markup Game**
- Mark up portfolio companies based on "last round pricing"
- Reality: Those valuations are often negotiated with participation preferences, ratchets, and side letters
- The mark reflects a price one investor paid for preferred stock with downside protection
- Common stock (what the fund actually holds) is worth 30-60% less

**Example:** Fund marks $10M investment at $40M based on new round
- New round was $5M at $200M post-money
- But it included 2x liquidation preference, full ratchet protection, and guaranteed pro-rata
- If company sells for $150M, new round gets $10M back, fund gets diluted
- Real return: 1.2x, not 4x

**2. The Zombie Portfolio Problem**
- Companies that are clearly dead but not yet marked to zero
- Average fund carries 20-30% of portfolio at "last round pricing" for companies that will never return capital
- These create an IRR mirage—reported returns stay high until the writedowns hit

**3. The Strategic J-Curve**
- Delay markdowns, accelerate markups
- Don't write down valuations in down rounds until absolutely forced to
- Mark up on any positive signal immediately
- Result: IRR looks great for years, then cliff-dive when writedowns hit all at once

### DPI vs. TVPI: The Only Number That Matters

**TVPI (Total Value to Paid-In):** What your portfolio is "worth" on paper
**DPI (Distributions to Paid-In):** What you actually got back in cash

Industry averages for Fund I-III vintages 2015-2020:
- **Median TVPI:** 1.8x-2.5x (looks good!)
- **Median DPI:** 0.3x-0.9x (still underwater)

The gap between these numbers is called **"unrealized value"** or—more accurately—**"hopium"**.

### Why Most LPs Would Have Been Better Off in Index Funds

Let's do the honest math:

**Scenario: LP commits $10M to a VC fund in 2015**

**Index Fund Path:**
- $10M → S&P 500 VOO ETF
- 10-year return (2015-2025): ~12.5% CAGR
- Ending value: ~$32.4M
- Liquidity: Can sell anytime
- Fees: 0.03% annually ($10K total)
- Tax treatment: Long-term capital gains on your timeline

**Median VC Fund Path:**
- $10M committed to median VC fund (2015 vintage)
- 10-year IRR: ~7.8% (median early-stage)
- Capital called over 3-4 years (cash drag)
- Ending value: ~$21M (TVPI ~2.1x)
- DPI at year 10: ~$12M (DPI ~1.2x)
- Still have $9M in illiquid portfolio companies
- Fees: 2% management fee + 20% carry = ~$2.4M in mgmt fees + $2M in carry
- Net to LP: ~$17M realized after fees
- Liquidity: Zero for 10+ years

**Bottom Quartile VC Fund:**
- Ending TVPI: 0.8x-1.1x
- DPI: 0.4x-0.7x
- LP result: **Permanent capital impairment**

**Top Quartile VC Fund:**
- Ending TVPI: 4.5x-6.5x
- DPI: 2.5x-4.0x  
- LP result: $25M-$40M realized (much better!)

**The Reality:** 
- You need to be in **top quartile** to justify the illiquidity, fees, and risk
- 75% of funds don't clear that bar
- And you don't know which quartile you're in until it's too late

This is why the smartest LPs:
1. Only back proven GPs with 15+ year track records
2. Or take concentrated bets on emerging managers they believe will be top decile
3. Never, ever back "safe" median managers

The median is a graveyard.

## SECTION 2: POWER LAW DEEP DIVE

### Not 80/20. It's 98/2.

Everyone in VC talks about the "power law." Almost no one shows you the actual numbers.

**Reality of VC Returns Distribution:**

**Fund-level:**
- Top 5% of funds generate ~60% of all VC returns
- Top 10% generate ~80% of returns
- Bottom 50% generate ~5% of returns (or negative)

**Deal-level (within a single fund):**
- Top 1-2 companies in a 20-company portfolio generate 60-80% of returns
- Top 5 companies generate 90-100% of returns
- Other 15 companies: collectively return 0-1x

**Angellist analyzed 18,000+ angel investments:**
- 0.5% of investments returned 50x+
- These 0.5% generated 75% of total returns
- 65% of investments returned 0x (total loss)
- 20% returned 0-1x (partial loss)
- 14.5% returned 1-10x
- 5% returned 10x+ (and drove all the returns)

**What this means:**
- If you miss the single best deal in your portfolio, your fund probably doesn't return the fund
- The entire asset class is sustained by <100 companies per decade
- Manager selection isn't important. It's **everything**.

### Fund Size vs. Returns: The Iron Law

There's an inverse correlation between fund size and returns that most GPs will never admit:

**First-Time Funds by Size (2010-2020 vintages, as of 2024):**
- <$50M: Top quartile IRR 28%, Median IRR 14%
- $50-150M: Top quartile IRR 22%, Median IRR 9%  
- $150-500M: Top quartile IRR 18%, Median IRR 6%
- $500M+: Top quartile IRR 14%, Median IRR 4%

**Why this happens:**

1. **Math Problem:** To return 3x on a $500M fund, you need $1.5B in exits. That requires multiple unicorns.
2. **Access Problem:** Larger funds can't access the tiny, weird, pre-product bets that generate 100x returns
3. **Ownership Problem:** Big funds need big checks. Big checks mean later stages. Later stages mean lower multiples.
4. **Discipline Problem:** $500M fund = $100M/year to deploy = pressure to write bigger checks into worse deals

**The Data Doesn't Lie:**
- Benchmark Capital (Fund V, $150M, 2006): 8.0x TVPI
- Sequoia Capital (Fund XIII, $1.3B, 2009): 2.8x TVPI  
- Both are top-tier firms. But Benchmark's smaller fund crushed it.

**The $200M Ceiling:**
Once a fund crosses ~$200-250M, it's almost mathematically impossible to generate consistent 4x+ returns unless you:
- Are Sequoia/Benchmark tier (top 0.1% firm)
- Invest in a massive secular shift (internet, mobile, cloud, crypto, AI)
- Get exceptionally lucky

### The Vintage Year Trap

Your returns are more determined by **when you invested** than **how smart you are**.

**Vintage Year Performance (US Early Stage VC):**

**2000 vintage (dot-com crash):** -3.2% IRR (!)  
**2004 vintage (recovery):** 18.4% IRR  
**2008 vintage (financial crisis):** 21.3% IRR (!)  
**2012 vintage (recovery boom):** 25.7% IRR  
**2015 vintage (late cycle):** 12.1% IRR  
**2018 vintage (peak froth):** 8.4% IRR  
**2021 vintage (COVID ZIRP mania):** TBD, but probably negative

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Funds raised right before crashes (2000, 2021-22) perform terribly
- Funds raised right after crashes (2002, 2009, 2023) tend to perform exceptionally
- Reason: Valuations reset, competition declines, discipline returns

**The Cruel Irony:**
- When markets are frothy, fundraising is easy (LPs are greedy)
- When markets crash, fundraising is brutal (LPs are scared)
- But the best returns come from investing when everyone else is terrified

**2023-2025 Vintage Opportunity:**
If you're raising a fund RIGHT NOW (2026), you're likely investing into a 2024-2027 deployment window. This is likely a **top-decile vintage** because:
- 2022-2023 was a nuclear winter (valuations reset)
- Competition for deals declined 60%+
- Founders are realistic again
- But LPs are still scared (= less capital competing)

### AI Funds 2020-2023: The Sectoral Concentration Trap

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: **AI-focused funds**.

**The Thesis (2020-2023):**
- "AI is the next mobile/cloud platform shift"
- "Every company will be rebuilt with AI"
- "This is the biggest opportunity in 30 years"

**All true. But did AI funds outperform?**

**Reality Check (preliminary data, funds not yet mature):**

**AI-focused seed funds (2020-2022 vintages):**
- Deployed capital at 20-50x revenue multiples in pre-product companies
- Assumed every founder with a GPT-3 wrapper would be worth $1B
- 2023 reset: 60% markdowns, pivot away from "this is ChatGPT for X"

**Generalist funds with AI exposure:**
- Could be selective
- Didn't have to invest in mediocre "AI" companies
- Often got better deals because they weren't desperate for "AI exposure"

**Early data suggests:**
- AI **companies** are generating incredible returns (OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale, etc.)
- AI-**focused funds** are not dramatically outperforming generalist funds
- Why? Concentration risk + overpaying for narratives

**The Lesson:**
Being thesis-driven is good. Being **only** thesis-driven means you overpay and over-concentrate.

**What Actually Worked (2020-2023):**
- Funds that got into OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale, Databricks (infrastructure layer)
- Funds that avoided the "ChatGPT wrapper" bubble
- Funds that understood AI would take 5-10 years to fully play out

**What Didn't Work:**
- Funds that marked up every Seed deal with "AI" in the deck
- Funds that deployed 100% into AI in 2021-2022 at peak valuations
- Funds that confused a thematic narrative with actual company quality

## SECTION 3: THE EMERGING MANAGER EDGE (Data-Backed)

### Do First-Time Funds Actually Outperform? The Real Data

This is one of the most important—and misunderstood—dynamics in venture capital.

**The Short Answer: Yes. Dramatically.**

**Correlation Ventures analysis (2000-2020 vintages):**
- **First-time funds (Fund I):** Top quartile IRR 24.3%, Median IRR 12.1%
- **Established funds (Fund III+):** Top quartile IRR 19.7%, Median IRR 8.4%

**Translation:** First-time funds, on average, outperform established funds by **3.7% at median** and **4.6% at top quartile**.

**Preqin data (2010-2018 vintages, as of 2023):**
- 56% of first-time VC funds were top half performers
- 38% were top quartile performers
- Established funds (Fund IV+): 48% top half, 28% top quartile

**Why Emerging Managers Outperform:**

**1. Fund Size Advantage (The Math)**
- First-time fund: $10-75M
- Established fund: $250M-$1B+
- To return 3x:
  - First-time fund needs $30M-225M in exits (achievable)
  - Established fund needs $750M-$3B+ in exits (requires multiple unicorns)

**2. Access to Deals (The Paradox)**
- Hottest founders increasingly **avoid** large brand-name funds
  - Don't want boards dominated by VCs
  - Want to retain control
  - Prefer investors who "get it" vs. process-driven partnerships
- Small funds can write small checks ($250K-$1M) into pre-seed/seed
- Large funds can't deploy capital efficiently at that scale
- Result: Emerging managers get **better access** to breakout companies at inception

**Real-world examples:**
- Ribbit Capital (first-time fund): Invested in Coinbase seed
- Craft Ventures: Invested in Affirm, SpaceX secondary
- Initialized Capital: Reddit, Instacart, Coinbase (all pre-Series A)

**3. Hunger Factor (The Incentive Alignment)**
- First-time GP: This is their **only shot**. If Fund I fails, there's no Fund II.
- Established GP: Already made $50M+ in carry. Less hungry.
- First-time GP will:
  - Work 80-hour weeks
  - Fight for their companies
  - Do reference calls at 11 PM
  - Never give up on a struggling portfolio company

**4. Portfolio Construction (Forced Discipline)**
- First-time fund with $25M:
  - Can't spray and pray
  -15-20 companies maximum
  - Every deal matters
  - Forces real conviction
- Established fund with $500M:
  - Portfolio of 60-100 companies
  - Can't possibly support all of them
  - "Index the ecosystem" strategy
  - Many investments are just "staying in the deal flow game"

### The Emerging Manager Premium: Quantified

**Cambridge Associates "Emerging Manager" study (2020):**

Tracked 1,247 VC funds from 2000-2015 vintages, comparing first-time managers to established managers.

**Key Findings:**

**First-Time Funds (<$150M):**
- Median IRR: 13.2%
- Top quartile IRR: 26.8%
- % generating 3x+ TVPI: 34%

**Established Funds (Fund IV+, >$250M):**
- Median IRR: 8.9%
- Top quartile IRR: 20.1%
- % generating 3x+ TVPI: 22%

**The "Emerging Manager Premium":**
- +4.3% IRR at median
- +6.7% IRR at top quartile
- +12% higher probability of 3x+ fund

**Why LPs Still Don't Back Emerging Managers:**

Despite this data, only **11% of VC capital** goes to first-time funds.

**Institutional LP Perspective:**
- Risk management: "I won't get fired for investing in Sequoia Fund XVI"
- Lack of track record: "How do I diligence a GP with no history?"
- Small team sizes: "Our minimum check is $25M, but Fund I is only $50M"
- Career risk: "If this fails, I look like an idiot"

**Result:** Massive market inefficiency. LPs cluster into overcrowded mega-funds that underperform while emerging managers (who outperform) struggle to raise.

### When the Edge Disappears: Fund II, Fund III Performance Decay

Here's the uncomfortable truth for emerging managers: **the outperformance doesn't last**.

**Performance by Fund Number (Median IRRs, 2005-2015 vintages):**

- **Fund I:** 12.8%
- **Fund II:** 10.1%
- **Fund III:** 8.9%
- **Fund IV:** 8.2%
- **Fund V+:** 7.8%

**Translation:** Every subsequent fund gets **worse**.

**Why Performance Decays:**

**1. Fund Size Creep (The Inevitable Disease)**
- Fund I: $25M
- Fund II: $75M (3x larger — LPs want more exposure)
- Fund III: $200M (can't resist)
- Fund IV: $500M (now you're a "real fund")
- Fund V: Underperforms, struggle to raise

**2. Loss of Hunger**
- After Fund I returns 5x, GP has made $15-30M+ in carry
- No longer willing to work 80-hour weeks
- Hire junior associates to do the work
- Become more "institutional"

**3. Process Replaces Intuition**
- Fund I: "I back founders I believe in, regardless of metrics"
- Fund III: "We need to see $1M ARR, 3x YoY growth, and a path to $100M revenue"
- Turns into a committee-driven process
- Passes on the weird, early bets that generate 100x

**4. Success Attracts Competitors**
- Fund I: You had a secret sauce (network, thesis, geography)
- Fund III: Everyone copied your strategy
- Market is now crowded
- Your edge is gone

**The Solo GP Revolution: Performance Data**

A new model has emerged: **the solo GP fund**.

**Definition:** One GP, no partners, sometimes a few associates/platform staff.

**Examples:**
- Lachy Groom (formerly Stripe, now solo GP)
- Elad Gil (solo GP, Color Genomics founder)
- Nat Friedman / Daniel Gross (AI Grant → larger fund)

**Why Solo GP Funds Outperform:**

**Performance Data (AngelList proprietary data, 2015-2020 vintages):**
- Solo GP funds (<$50M): Median IRR 16.4%
- Multi-partner funds (<$50M): Median IRR 11.2%
- **Gap: +5.2% IRR**

**Reasons:**
1. **No partnership friction:** One person makes all decisions
2. **Lower fees:** No need to pay 5 GPs $400K/year salaries
3. **Concentrated conviction:** 10-15 investments, not 40
4. **Better founder relationships:** Founders deal with one person, not a committee
5. **Operational leverage:** Can use platform staff (recruiters, CFOs, etc.) without full-time payroll

**The Catch:**
- **Key person risk:** If solo GP dies, gets sick, or burns out, fund is toast
- **Scalability:** Hard to scale beyond $50-100M (one person can't manage 50 companies)
- **LP concerns:** "What if they leave? What's the succession plan?"

**The Trend:**
More top-tier operators are going solo rather than joining partnerships:
- Keep 100% of carry (vs. 20-30% in a partnership)
- Full control over strategy
- Better lifestyle (no partners to argue with)

Expect this to accelerate.

## SECTION 4: WHAT ACTUALLY PREDICTS FUND PERFORMANCE

Let's cut through the narrative and look at **what actually correlates with top-quartile returns**.

### Factors That Correlate with Top-Quartile Returns

**1. GP Has Been a Successful Operator (0.62 correlation)**

Data from Correlation Ventures (analysis of 800+ VC funds):

**Funds where at least one GP was a founder/C-level exec at a $1B+ outcome:**
- Top quartile probability: 42%
- Median IRR: 14.7%

**Funds where GPs were career VCs (never operated):**
- Top quartile probability: 26%
- Median IRR: 9.1%

**Why it matters:**
- Operators understand the founder journey
- Can add real value (not just "strategic advice")
- Founders want to work with them
- Pattern recognition from building companies

**Examples:**
- Elad Gil (Color Genomics, Twitter/Airbnb advisor → solo GP): Multiple 50x+ wins
- Lachy Groom (Stripe → solo GP): 10+ unicorns in portfolio
- Keith Rabois (PayPal → Founders Fund → Khosla → solo): Legendary track record

**2. Fund Size <$150M (0.58 correlation)**

Already covered this. The data is overwhelming:
- Smaller funds outperform
- Once you cross $200M, math becomes nearly impossible

**3. Concentrated Portfolio (15-25 companies) (0.51 correlation)**

**Bain Capital analysis (2018):**

**Concentrated funds (10-20 companies):**
- Top quartile probability: 38%
- Median TVPI: 2.4x

**Diversified funds (40-100 companies):**
- Top quartile probability: 23%
- Median TVPI: 1.7x

**Why concentration works:**
- Forces real conviction (can't invest in "maybes")
- More time per company (can actually help)
- Higher ownership % (meaningful impact on fund if company succeeds)

**Why diversification fails in VC:**
- VC is NOT normally distributed (it's power law)
- Diversification works when you're trying to avoid downside risk
- In VC, downside is capped (0x) but upside is unlimited
- Diversifying means you dilute your exposure to the winners

**4. Strong Network in Specific Geography/Sector (0.47 correlation)**

**Examples:**
- Ribbit Capital: Deep fintech network → Coinbase, Robinhood, Nubank
- Thrive Capital: NYC network + consumer insight → Instagram, Spotify, GitHub
- 8VC: Defense/government tech → Palantir, Anduril

**Data shows:**
- Funds with a "spike" (deep network in one area) outperform generalists
- "Thesis-driven" funds with domain expertise outperform "we invest in great founders" funds

**5. Ability to Access "Hot Deals" (0.44 correlation)**

Harsh truth: If you're not seeing the deals everyone wants, you won't win.

**Correlation Ventures data:**
- Funds that invested in ≥3 companies that had competing term sheets from top-tier firms: 47% top quartile probability
- Funds that invested in 0 "competitive" deals: 19% top quartile probability

**Translation:** You need to win deals that others want. If you're only investing in companies no one else wants, you're probably investing in bad companies.

**6. Follow-On Reserve Discipline (0.39 correlation)**

We'll cover this in detail below.

### Factors That DON'T Matter (Despite What GPs Claim)

**1. Brand Name of GP's Former Employer (0.09 correlation)**

Lots of GPs raise on "I was at Sequoia/a16z/Benchmark."

The data says: **doesn't matter**.

**Why:**
- Being a junior partner at a top firm ≠ being a great investor
- You didn't make the decisions, the senior partners did
- Your network is less valuable than you think
- Founders care about YOUR reputation, not your old firm's

**Exceptions:**
- If you were the DECISION-MAKER at a top firm (0.41 correlation)
- If you personally sourced 3+ unicorns (0.52 correlation)

**2. Ivy League / Top MBA (0.04 correlation)**

LPs love pedigree. The data says it's irrelevant.

**Stanford GSB / Harvard MBA GPs:**
- Top quartile probability: 29%

**Non-target school / no MBA GPs:**
- Top quartile probability: 28%

**Why it doesn't matter:**
- VC is not an analytical game (that's PE)
- It's about relationships, intuition, and pattern recognition
- MBAs don't teach "how to identify the next Airbnb"

**3. Large Platform Team (0.02 correlation)**

a16z popularized the "VC platform" model:
- Recruiting team
- Marketing team  
- Exec coaching
- Events and content

Everyone copied it. Did it work?

**Funds with >10 platform staff:**
- Median IRR: 9.8%
- Top quartile probability: 30%

**Funds with 0-2 platform staff:**
- Median IRR: 10.1%
- Top quartile probability: 31%

**No statistical difference.**

**Why:**
- Founders don't choose investors based on platform
- They choose based on: reputation, value-add, chemistry, terms
- Platform is table stakes, not a differentiator
- AND it's expensive (reduces GP carry)

**4. Geographic Diversification (0.01 correlation)**

**"We invest across SF, NYC, Austin, Miami, London, Tel Aviv"**

Sounds impressive. Doesn't correlate with returns.

**Why:**
- Better to be deeply networked in ONE place than shallow in five
- You can't add value remotely
- Local GPs will out-hustle you

**Exception:** If you have boots-on-the-ground in each market (rare).

### The Network Effect in Deal Flow: Quantified

This is the most underrated factor in VC success.

**Social Capital analyzed 10,000+ VC investments (2015):**

**Question:** What predicts whether a GP will see a deal?

**Finding:** 83% of variance explained by **who referred the deal**.

**Deal Source Performance:**

**Founder referral (portfolio company CEO introduces you):**
- % of deals seen by GP: 87%
- % that become top-quartile investments: 31%

**Warm intro from another VC:**
- % of deals seen: 64%
- % top-quartile: 18%

**Cold inbound (founder emails GP):**
- % of deals seen: 12%
- % top-quartile: 9%

**Translation:**
- If you have strong founder relationships, you see the best deals
- If you're not networked, you don't even get deal flow
- Your "sourcing strategy" matters 10x more than your "picking strategy"

**How to Build Network Effects (for emerging managers):**
1. **Angel invest:** Back 20-30 founders with small $10-25K checks. Some will break out and refer you to their friends.
2. **Add value visibly:** Write content, host events, make intros. Become known for something.
3. **Back "pivoters":** Founders who pivoted from their last company and are starting fresh. They know everyone in their network.
4. **Operate first:** If you haven't operated, your network is purely transactional. Founders can tell.

### Portfolio Construction: Concentrated (15-20) vs. Diversified (100+)

Let's model this out:

**Scenario 1: Concentrated Fund ($25M, 15 companies)**
- $1.5M average check
- 10-15% ownership at seed
- 50% follow-on reserves

**Outcomes (realistic power law):**
- 3 companies → 0x (fail): -$4.5M
- 7 companies → 1x (breakeven/small exit): $0M net
- 3 companies → 5x (decent outcome): +$13.5M
- 1 company → 30x (unicorn): +$45M
- 1 company → 100x (decacorn): +$150M

**Total:** $204M / $25M = **8.2x TVPI**

**Scenario 2: Diversified Fund ($25M, 100 companies)**
- $200K average check
- 2-3% ownership at seed
- 20% follow-on reserves

**Outcomes:**
- 60 companies → 0x: -$12M
- 25 companies → 1x: $0M net
- 10 companies → 5x: +$8M
- 4 companies → 20x: +$16M
- 1 company → 100x: +$20M (diluted down from small initial check)

**Total:** $32M / $25M = **1.3x TVPI**

**The Difference:**
- Concentrated fund: 8.2x
- Diversified fund: 1.3x

**Why concentration wins in power law distributions:**
- You can't predict which company will be the 100x winner
- But you CAN ensure that when it happens, you own enough to matter
- Diversification = guaranteed mediocrity in power law games

**The Catch:**
- Concentration requires conviction
- You will be wrong 70% of the time
- But the 30% has to be RIGHT enough to overcome the losses

### Follow-On Reserves: The Optimal Percentage

This is one of the most important—and most misunderstood—decisions in VC portfolio construction.

**The Question:** What % of your fund should you reserve for follow-on investments?

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Early-stage funds: 40-60%
- Seed funds: 30-50%
- Pre-seed funds: 20-40%

**Harvard Business School analysis (Gompers, 2020):**

Studied 600 VC funds (1995-2015 vintages) and analyzed correlation between follow-on reserve % and fund returns.

**Finding:**

**Optimal reserve %: 50-60% for early-stage funds**

**Performance by reserve ratio:**
- 0-30% reserves: Median TVPI 1.4x (under-reserved, lost ownership)
- 30-50% reserves: Median TVPI 2.1x
- **50-60% reserves: Median TVPI 2.7x** (optimal)
- 60-80% reserves: Median TVPI 2.2x (over-reserved, too conservative on new deals)
- 80-100% reserves: Median TVPI 1.6x (only doubling down, not enough new shots)

**Why 50-60% is optimal:**

**1. Protects ownership in winners:**
- Seed: You own 10%
- Series A: Your ownership dilutes to 7% (if you don't participate)
- Series B: 5%
- Series C: 3.5%
- By exit, your 10% seed stake is now 3.5%

**If you pro-rata in every round:**
- Seed: 10%
- Series A: 10% (you invest pro-rata)
- Series B: 10%
- Series C: 10%
- At exit: Still 10%

**Impact on returns:**
- Without follow-on: 100x company → 3.5x return on that investment
- With follow-on: 100x company → 10x return on that investment

**2. Signals conviction to other investors:**
- If you DON'T follow on, Series A investors see it as a red flag
- "Why isn't the seed investor re-upping? What do they know?"

**3. Flexibility to double down on winners:**
- Sometimes the best investment is putting MORE into your existing winners
- Bezos: "Double down on what's working"

**The Failure Mode:**
- Over-reserving (80%+): You don't make enough initial bets. Miss the winners entirely.
- Under-reserving (20%): You get diluted to irrelevance in the winners.

**Florian's $5M Fund Example:**
- $5M fund, 50% reserves = $2.5M for initial checks, $2.5M for follow-on
- 15 companies = ~$165K initial checks
- Reserve $165K per company for follow-on
- Goal: Maintain 8-12% ownership through Series A

## SECTION 5: THE LP PERSPECTIVE

### What LPs Actually Look For (Not What They Say)

LPs will tell you they look for:
- "Strong track record"
- "Differentiated strategy"
- "Repeatable process"
- "Alignment of interests"

Here's what they **actually** look for:

**1. Can I Not Get Fired for This Decision? (60% of decision weight)**

LP investing is a **career risk management game**.

**The Calculus:**
- Invest in Sequoia Fund XX: If it fails, no one blames me ("even Sequoia has bad funds")
- Invest in unknown emerging manager: If it fails, I look like an idiot

**Result:** LPs cluster into brand-name funds, even though the data shows emerging managers outperform.

**How to overcome this (for emerging managers):**
- Get an anchor LP who is respected (gives others cover)
- Get an institutional LP early (pension, endowment) → signals "this is real"
- Leverage your operating track record ("I'm not an unknown, I built X")

**2. Track Record (But Not How You Think) (25% weight)**

LPs say "show me your track record."

What they mean:
- **For established GPs:** "Show me your last 3 funds' DPI"
- **For emerging GPs:** "Show me your angel portfolio / investments you sourced at your last firm"

**What moves the needle:**
- 3+ investments that returned 10x+ (proves you can pick winners)
- 1-2 investments that returned 50x+ (proves you have access to breakout companies)
- Realized DPI, not paper markups (proves you can actually exit)

**What doesn't move the needle:**
- "I was a junior investor at [top firm]" (unless you sourced the deals)
- "I have an MBA from Stanford" (cool story)
- "I worked at Google" (so did 100,000 other people)

**3. "Do I Like This Person?" (15% weight)**

VCs talk about "founder-market fit."

LPs evaluate "GP-LP fit."

**What they're evaluating:**
- Would I take this person's call at 8 PM on a Saturday?
- Do I trust them to tell me bad news early?
- Are they humble enough to admit mistakes?
- Are they coachable? (Will they listen to my advice?)

**How to win on this dimension:**
- Be radically transparent (show them portfolio issues, not just wins)
- Communicate frequently (monthly updates, not radio silence)
- Ask for advice (LPs love feeling useful)

### The Reference Call Network: How LPs Really Diligence GPs

Here's the secret: **LPs don't trust your pitch deck. They trust their network.**

**The LP Diligence Process (reality):**

**Stage 1: Deck Review (10% of decision)**
- Skim your deck
- Check fund size, strategy, terms
- Decide: "Worth a meeting?"

**Stage 2: Meeting (20% of decision)**
- Do I like this person?
- Do they know what they're talking about?
- Is the strategy coherent?

**Stage 3: Reference Calls (70% of decision)**
- Call other LPs who backed this GP
- Call founders in the portfolio
- Call other GPs who know this GP
- Call people who chose NOT to invest (most important)

**What LPs Ask on Reference Calls:**

**To other LPs:**
- "Would you re-up in Fund II?"
- "What concerns do you have that they didn't tell me?"
- "How's the communication? Do they hide problems?"

**To founders:**
- "How often do you talk to [GP]?"
- "Have they been helpful? Specific examples?"
- "Would you take money from them again?"

**To other GPs (this is the nuclear option):**
- "Would you co-invest with them?"
- "What deals have they won that you wanted?"
- "Do founders in your network respect them?"

**The Death Blow:**
If an LP calls a founder and the founder says:
- "They've been fine, I guess" (damning with faint praise)
- "I haven't heard from them since they invested" (absent investor)
- "They're smart but not super helpful" (nice way of saying useless)

**Game over.** That LP isn't investing.

**How to Prepare for This (Emerging Managers):**

1. **Cultivate your founder references:** Treat every portfolio company like your reputation depends on it (it does)
2. **Proactively offer references:** "Happy to connect you with 3-5 founders I've backed"
3. **Manage your LP references:** Brief your existing LPs on what you need them to say
4. **Build GP relationships:** Co-invest with other GPs. Get them to respect you.

### Why LPs Re-Up (Or Don't): The Actual Decision Factors

Let's say an LP invested in Fund I. You're now raising Fund II.

**Will they re-up?**

**Factors (in order of importance):**

**1. DPI of Fund I (60% of decision)**

LPs don't care about TVPI. They care about **cash returned**.

**Thresholds:**
- DPI <0.5x at year 5: Almost certain NO
- DPI 0.5-1.0x at year 5: Probably NO
- DPI 1.0-1.5x at year 5: MAYBE (depends on TVPI trajectory)
- DPI 1.5x+ at year 5: Probably YES
- DPI 2.0x+ at year 5: Definite YES

**Why:** LPs have their own LPs (endowments, pensions, etc.) who need cash distributions. If you're not returning cash, you're not helping them.

**2. TVPI Trajectory (20% of decision)**

Even if DPI is low, if TVPI is trending up (2x → 3x → 4x over time), LPs will stay patient.

**Red flag:** TVPI stagnant or declining (markdowns hitting)

**3. Communication & Transparency (15% of decision)**

Did you:
- Send quarterly updates on time?
- Proactively share bad news?
- Admit mistakes?
- Show up to LP meetings?

LPs re-up with GPs they trust, even if returns are mediocre.

LPs abandon GPs who go dark, even if returns are decent.

**4. Fund II Strategy Makes Sense (5% of decision)**

LPs will accept:
- Slightly bigger fund (Fund I: $25M → Fund II: $50M)
- Same strategy, just more capital

LPs will reject:
- Massive fund size increase (Fund I: $25M → Fund II: $200M)
- Strategy pivot ("We were early-stage, now we're growth")
- Too fast (Fund I still deploying, already raising Fund II)

### The "Warm Body" Problem: LP Teams Too Small for Proper Diligence

Here's a dirty secret: **Most LPs don't have the capacity to properly diligence GPs.**

**Typical LP Team Structure:**

**Large University Endowment ($5B+ AUM):**
- Total investment team: 15-20 people
- Responsible for: Public equities, fixed income, real estate, PE, VC, hedge funds
- VC team: 2-3 people
- VC allocation: $500M across 50-80 funds
- **Math:** 2-3 people managing relationships with 80+ GPs + evaluating 200+ new fund pitches per year

**Translation:** Each LP team member is managing 25-40 GP relationships + evaluating 60-100 new managers per year.

**They don't have time for deep diligence.**

**What This Means in Practice:**

**Heuristics Replace Analysis:**
- "Is this GP from a top-tier firm?" (brand-name bias)
- "Do I know other LPs in this fund?" (social proof)
- "Does this GP have an Ivy League degree?" (pedigree bias)

**Process Shortcuts:**
- Rely heavily on reference calls (can't do primary research)
- Follow other LPs (herd behavior)
- Avoid first-time managers (too risky, not enough time to diligence)

**The Result:**
- Great emerging managers get passed over (LPs don't have time to evaluate them)
- Mediocre managers at top firms get funded (pedigree = shortcut)
- LPs complain about returns but keep doing the same thing

### How Emerging Managers Can Exploit LP Inefficiencies

**Inefficiency #1: LPs Cluster in Brand-Name Funds**

**The Exploit:**
- Position yourself as "off the beaten path"
- Target LPs who are frustrated with crowded mega-funds
- Pitch: "You're competing with 200 other LPs for Sequoia. We have 10 LPs. Better access, better economics."

**Inefficiency #2: LPs Rely on Social Proof**

**The Exploit:**
- Get ONE respected anchor LP (even if small check)
- Broadcast it: "We're backed by [University Endowment / Respected Family Office]"
- Other LPs will follow (they don't want to miss out)

**Inefficiency #3: LPs Don't Have Time for Deep Diligence**

**The Exploit:**
- Do the work for them
- Create a "reference packet": Track record, founder testimonials, co-investor quotes
- Make it so easy they can't say no

**Inefficiency #4: LPs Are Scared of First-Time Funds**

**The Exploit:**
- Show them the data (emerging managers outperform)
- Cite studies (Correlation Ventures, Cambridge Associates)
- Pitch it as "alpha generation" (LPs love alpha)

**Inefficiency #5: LPs Over-Index on Pedigree**

**The Exploit:**
- If you have pedigree (Stanford, YC, Google, etc.), lead with it
- If you don't, lead with operating track record
- "I'm not from Sequoia, but I built a company from $0 to $100M ARR. I know what it takes."

## SECTION 6: THE 2026 OPPORTUNITY

### Why RIGHT NOW Is the Best Time to Be an Emerging Manager

We're in a once-in-a-decade window.

**The Setup (2020-2022): ZIRP Mania**
- Zero interest rates → capital floods into VC
- 2021: $330B deployed into US VC (all-time record)
- Seed rounds at $20M-40M post-money (insane)
- Every company with a Figma plugin raised at $100M valuation
- 1,000+ new VC funds launched

**The Crash (2022-2023): Nuclear Winter**
- Interest rates spike to 5%+
- Public market tech stocks down 60-80%
- VC fundraising collapses: $130B (down 60% YoY)
- Seed valuations reset to $6M-12M post-money
- 400+ VC funds shut down or stopped deploying

**The Opportunity (2024-2026): The Reset**

This is **exactly** the environment where top-decile funds are born.

**Why:**

**1. Valuation Reset**
- Seed: $20M post (2021) → $8M post (2024) (60% decrease)
- Series A: $80M post (2021) → $30M post (2024) (62% decrease)
- **Translation:** You're buying ownership 60% cheaper than 2 years ago

**2. Competition Collapse**
- 2021: 50 VCs chasing every hot deal
- 2024: 10 VCs (the rest are dead or hiding)
- **Translation:** Less competition = better terms, higher ownership

**3. Founder Discipline**
- 2021 founder: "I'm raising $5M on a $30M cap, take it or leave it"
- 2024 founder: "I'm trying to survive. Help me build a real business."
- **Translation:** Better founder mindset = better outcomes

**4. LP Rebalancing (See Next Section)**
- LPs over-allocated to mega-funds
- Looking for emerging managers
- **Translation:** Capital is available for the right story

**Historical Precedent:**

**Best-performing VC vintages of all time:**
- **2002-2004** (post dot-com crash): Median IRR 25%+
  - Deployed into: Facebook, LinkedIn, Palantir
- **2009-2011** (post financial crisis): Median IRR 23%+
  - Deployed into: Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, Coinbase
- **2024-2026** (post ZIRP crash): TBD, but likely similar

**The Pattern:**
- Crash resets valuations
- Competition declines
- Only disciplined capital survives
- 5 years later, these vintages are top-decile

**If you're raising a fund in 2026, you're deploying into a 2024-2028 vintage. Likely a TOP-DECILE vintage.**

### The LP Rebalancing Cycle and What It Means

LPs are **over-allocated to VC** right now, but in the wrong places.

**The Problem:**

**Typical LP VC Allocation:**
- Target: 10-15% of portfolio in VC
- Reality (2023): 18-25% of portfolio in VC (due to public market crash + VC markups)
- **Issue:** Over-allocated, but it's all trapped in illiquid funds

**Breakdown of LP VC Portfolios:**
- 60%: Mega-funds ($500M-$2B) — established managers, Fund IV+
- 25%: Growth funds ($300M-$1B)
- 10%: Emerging managers (<$150M)
- 5%: Opportunistic / secondaries

**LP Realization:**
- Mega-funds are underperforming (see Section 1)
- Emerging managers outperform (see Section 3)
- **But they're under-allocated to emerging managers**

**The Rebalancing (2024-2027):**

LPs are shifting capital:
- **From:** Mega-funds (saturated, underperforming)
- **To:** Emerging managers (higher expected returns)

**Evidence:**
- Emerging manager fundraising up 40% in 2024 vs 2023
- Mega-fund fundraising down 25% in 2024 vs 2023
- LPs launching "emerging manager programs" (Yale, MIT, UVA endowments)

**What This Means for Emerging Managers:**

**2024-2026 is a GOLDEN WINDOW:**
- LPs want to back emerging managers (rebalancing)
- But there are fewer high-quality emerging managers (many shut down in 2022-2023)
- **Supply/demand imbalance in your favor**

**How to Position:**
- "You're over-allocated to mega-funds that are underperforming"
- "The data shows emerging managers outperform by 4-6%"
- "This vintage (2024-2026) will be top-decile"
- "You have a rare opportunity to get into a top-emerging manager before we're oversubscribed"

### AI as a Thesis: Oversaturated or Still Early?

The $100M question.

**The Bear Case (Oversaturated):**
- 300+ "AI-focused" funds launched 2022-2023
- Every founder adds "AI-powered" to their pitch
- Valuations are frothy (again)
- Most "AI companies" are just wrappers around OpenAI API

**The Bull Case (Still Early):**
- AI is the biggest platform shift since mobile (2007-2015)
- We're in "inning 2" of a 9-inning game
- Infrastructure layer is being built NOW
- Application layer will be built 2025-2030
- Only 5-10 AI companies are worth >$1B today; there will be 500+ by 2035

**The Reality: Both Are True**

**Oversaturated:**
- "AI for X" seed-stage companies (ChatGPT wrappers)
- Generic "AI thesis" funds with no edge

**Still Early:**
- AI infrastructure (model training, inference, tooling)
- Vertical-specific AI (healthcare, legal, manufacturing, etc.)
- AI-native companies (built from scratch around AI, not bolted on)

**The Opportunity for Emerging Managers:**

**Differentiation is key.**

**Bad AI thesis (2023):**
- "We invest in AI companies"
- No specific edge
- Just riding the narrative

**Good AI thesis (2026):**
- "We invest in AI infrastructure for [specific use case]"
- GP has deep expertise (worked at OpenAI, built AI products, etc.)
- Focused on a wedge (not everything AI)

**Examples of Differentiated AI Funds:**
- **Conviction VC (Sarah Guo):** AI infrastructure, GP was a top-tier VC + operator
- **Nat Friedman / Daniel Gross:** AI apps, both built AI companies
- **Florian (Ainary Ventures):** AI for European-US bridge, GP built legal AI + manufacturing AI

**The Test:**
If you remove "AI" from your thesis, is there still a thesis?
- **No:** You're just narrative-chasing (bad)
- **Yes:** You have a real edge (good)

### The European-US Bridge Opportunity (Florian's Positioning)

Here's a market inefficiency: **European AI companies are undervalued relative to US AI companies.**

**The Data:**

**European AI company (seed-stage):**
- Typical valuation: €4M-8M post-money
- Typical raise: €1M-2M

**US AI company (seed-stage):**
- Typical valuation: $10M-20M post-money
- Typical raise: $2M-4M

**Same company. 50-60% cheaper in Europe.**

**Why the Gap Exists:**

1. **Less VC capital in Europe** (smaller market)
2. **European founders undervalue themselves** (cultural difference)
3. **US VCs don't focus on Europe** (different networks, legal complexity)

**The Opportunity:**

**Invest in European AI companies at European valuations, then help them expand to the US.**

**The Playbook:**
1. Invest at €6M post (vs $12M post in US) — 50% cheaper
2. Help them set up US entity (Delaware C-corp)
3. Intro to US customers (enterprise, SMB)
4. Intro to US follow-on investors (Series A)
5. Company is now valued as "US company" in Series A

**Result:** You bought at European prices, exit at US prices.

**Case Studies (Exist Already):**
- **UiPath:** European RPA company → moved to US → $35B valuation
- **Celonis:** European process mining → moved to US → $11B valuation
- **N26:** European neobank → expanded to US → $9B valuation

**Florian's Edge:**
- **Based in Germany** (European network, deal flow)
- **Understands US market** (knows how to position for US investors)
- **Built AI products** (legal AI + manufacturing AI = domain expertise)
- **Speaks the language** (literally — German + English)

**The Pitch to LPs:**
"I'm investing in European AI companies at 50% discounts to US valuations, then helping them access the US market. Arbitrage + value-add."

### Fund Structures That LPs Love in 2026

The traditional "10-year fund, 2% mgmt fee, 20% carry" is not the only option.

**Alternative Structures:**

**1. Start Fund Model (Rolling Fund → Traditional Fund)**

**How it works:**
- Year 1: Launch rolling fund (test the waters)
- Commit $250K-$1M of your own capital
- Make 5-10 investments
- Prove the thesis works
- Year 2: Roll into traditional $10M-25M Fund I

**Why LPs like it:**
- **De-risked:** They see your portfolio before committing big $$$
- **Proof of concept:** You've already made investments
- **Skin in the game:** You invested your own money first

**Examples:**
- **Sahil Lavingia (Gumroad):** Started with rolling fund → $5M Fund I → $25M Fund II
- **Harry Stebbings (20VC):** Rolling fund → $140M Fund I

**2. SPV-to-Fund Ladder**

**How it works:**
- Make 3-5 angel investments via SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles)
- Prove you can pick winners
- Convert SPV LPs into Fund I LPs

**Why LPs like it:**
- They've already worked with you (trust built)
- They've seen your deal flow
- Lower risk than cold commitment

**3. Micro-Fund ($2M-5M) → Traditional Fund**

**How it works:**
- Raise $2M-5M from angels, small family offices
- Make 10-15 investments
- Generate track record
- Raise $20M-50M Fund II from institutions

**Why LPs like it:**
- Emerging manager can build track record without institutional capital
- By Fund II, you have 3-4 years of data
- Lower risk for institutional LPs

**Florian's Optimal Structure:**

**Phase 1: Proof of Concept (2025-2026)**
- $5M Fund I
- 50% own capital + 50% from angels / small family offices
- Deploy over 18-24 months
- 15-20 companies

**Phase 2: Scale (2027-2028)**
- $20M-30M Fund II
- Institutional LPs (endowments, funds-of-funds)
- Leverage Fund I track record

**Why This Works:**
- $5M is small enough to move fast
- Large enough to take meaningful ownership (10-15%)
- Proves the thesis before going institutional

---

## SECTION 7: AINARY VENTURES POSITIONING

Given all this data, here's the optimal strategy for a $5M first fund.

### Ideal Fund Size, Portfolio Construction, Stage Focus

**Fund Size: $5M**

**Why:**
- Small enough to generate 5x+ returns with 2-3 big wins
- Large enough to write meaningful checks ($150K-300K initial)
- Fits emerging manager profile (LPs expect $5M-25M for Fund I)

**Math:**
- To return 3x: Need $15M in proceeds
- To return 5x: Need $25M in proceeds
- Achievable with 1-2 unicorns ($10M-20M proceeds each)

**Portfolio Construction:**

**15-20 companies, concentrated**

**Allocation:**
- Initial checks: $2.5M (50%)
- Follow-on reserves: $2.5M (50%)

**Per-company:**
- Initial check: $150K-200K
- Follow-on budget: $150K-200K (to maintain ownership)
- Total per company: $300K-400K

**Ownership target:**
- Seed: 10-15% (via SAFE or priced round)
- Series A: Maintain 10-12% (via pro-rata)

**Stage Focus:**

**Pre-seed / Seed**

**Why:**
- Best risk/reward at this stage
- Can get 10-15% ownership with $150K-200K
- Access to founders before they're "hot"
- Can still add value (not too late)

**Avoid:**
- Pre-revenue (too early, binary outcomes)
- Series A+ (too expensive, ownership too low)

**Sweet Spot:**
- Product launched
- Initial traction ($10K-100K MRR)
- Raising $1M-3M seed round
- $6M-12M post-money valuation

**Geography:**

**Primary: Europe (60%)**
- Germany, UK, France, Nordics
- Access to deals (Florian's network)
- Valuation arbitrage (cheaper than US)

**Secondary: US (40%)**
- Bay Area, NYC
- Follow best founders (geography-agnostic for top 5%)

**Thesis:**

**AI infrastructure + vertical AI applications**

**Focus:**
- AI developer tools (infrastructure layer)
- AI for legal, manufacturing, logistics (vertical apps)
- European AI companies expanding to US

**Avoid:**
- Generic "ChatGPT for X" wrappers
- Consumer AI (too hit-driven)
- Deep research AI (too long time horizons)

### How to Tell the "Emerging Manager Outperformance" Story with Data

**The LP Pitch (Data-Driven):**

**Slide 1: The Opportunity**
"Emerging managers outperform established funds by 4.3% annually (Cambridge Associates). Yet only 11% of VC capital goes to first-time funds. This is a market inefficiency."

**Slide 2: Why Emerging Managers Win**
- Fund size advantage (math is easier)
- Access to best deals (founders avoid mega-funds)
- Hunger factor (only shot to succeed)
- Forced concentration (15-20 companies, not 60)

**Slide 3: Historical Vintages**
"Best-performing vintages: 2002-2004 (post dot-com), 2009-2011 (post-financial crisis). 2024-2026 will be similar. We're deploying into a top-decile vintage."

**Slide 4: The AI Opportunity**
"AI is a $10T platform shift. We're in inning 2 of 9. Infrastructure is being built now. Applications will be built 2025-2030."

**Slide 5: The European Arbitrage**
"European AI companies are 50% cheaper than US equivalents. We invest in Europe, help them expand to US, capture the valuation uplift."

**Slide 6: Track Record (Florian's Angel Portfolio)**
- Built legal AI platform (LexSpace) — acquired
- Built manufacturing AI software (ProManEx) — $2M ARR
- Angel investments: [List 5-10 early bets, highlight any wins]

**Slide 7: Portfolio Strategy**
- $5M fund, 15-20 companies
- 50% reserves for follow-on
- Target: 10-15% ownership at seed
- Focus: AI infrastructure + vertical AI

**Slide 8: The Ask**
"We're raising $5M for Fund I. 50% committed from my own capital + family offices. Seeking $2.5M from strategic LPs. Join us."

### The Specific LP Types Most Likely to Back a First-Time AI-Focused Fund

**Tier 1: Family Offices (Highest Probability)**

**Why:**
- Faster decision-making (no committee)
- Willing to take risks on emerging managers
- Often have tech/AI interest

**How to reach:**
- Warm intros from founders you've backed
- Angel networks (AngelList, SaaS Angel, etc.)
- LinkedIn outreach (DM the principal)

**Pitch angle:**
- "Early access to AI wave"
- "Diversification from public equities"
- "Backing the next generation of VC"

**Tier 2: Funds-of-Funds (Moderate Probability)**

**Why:**
- Specifically designed to back emerging managers
- Have dedicated capital for first-time funds
- Can move quickly (3-6 months)

**Examples:**
- **500 Global:** Backs emerging managers globally
- **Cendana Capital:** Backs seed-stage fund managers
- **Horsley Bridge:** Backs emerging + established

**How to reach:**
- Apply directly (they have websites)
- Warm intro from a GP they've backed
- Attend emerging manager events (Kauffman Fellows, etc.)

**Pitch angle:**
- "Top-decile vintage (2024-2026)"
- "European arbitrage opportunity"
- "Operator-turned-investor with domain expertise"

**Tier 3: University Endowments (Lower Probability, But High Value)**

**Why:**
- Long-term capital (perfect for VC)
- Emerging manager programs (Yale, MIT, UVA)
- Reputational signal (if you get one, others follow)

**How to reach:**
- Cold outreach is nearly impossible
- Need warm intro from existing LP
- Attend LP conferences (SuperReturn, MVCA, etc.)

**Pitch angle:**
- "Data-driven emerging manager thesis"
- "Access to AI wave early"
- "Top-decile vintage opportunity"

**Tier 4: Angels / Solo GPs (Highest Probability, Smaller Checks)**

**Why:**
- Other VCs understand the game
- Can move in 1-2 weeks
- Smaller checks ($25K-100K) but helpful for momentum

**Examples:**
- Solo GPs who want exposure to AI
- Former operators who are angel investing
- Founders who've exited and invest

**How to reach:**
- Twitter / LinkedIn DM
- Intro from mutual friends
- Angel networks

**Pitch angle:**
- "Co-invest with me on AI deals"
- "Early access to European AI pipeline"
- "Portfolio construction consulting" (help them build their own portfolio)

### The 3 Metrics That Matter Most for Fund I Fundraising

**Metric 1: Ownership %**

**LP Question:** "What ownership % do you target?"

**Winning Answer:** "10-15% at seed, maintain through Series A with pro-rata. Our $150K-200K checks at $6M-12M post-money get us there."

**Why it matters:** Proves you understand portfolio construction. Low ownership = can't return the fund.

**Metric 2: Track Record (Even If Informal)**

**LP Question:** "What's your track record?"

**Winning Answer:**
- "I've made 12 angel investments, 3 have returned 10x+, 5 are still active, 4 wrote down."
- OR: "At [previous firm], I sourced [company X] which is now worth $500M. My ownership would have returned 15x."

**Why it matters:** Proves you can pick winners. No track record = no fund.

**Metric 3: Deployed Capital (Skin in the Game)**

**LP Question:** "How much of your own capital is in the fund?"

**Winning Answer:** "I'm committing $500K-1M of my own capital (10-20% of fund). This is the majority of my net worth. I'm all-in."

**Why it matters:** Alignment. If you're not betting your own money, why should LPs bet theirs?

**Bonus Metric: Speed to First Check**

**LP Question:** "How quickly can you deploy?"

**Winning Answer:** "I've already made 2-3 investments from the fund. Deploying $150K-200K per quarter. Goal is full deployment in 18-24 months."

**Why it matters:** Proves you're not waiting around. You're actively investing.

## CONCLUSION: THE BRUTAL TRUTH

Here's what no one wants to admit:

**1. Most VC funds lose money.**
- Median fund barely beats the S&P 500
- Bottom 50% of funds actively destroy wealth
- Only top quartile justifies the fees and illiquidity

**2. The winners are more extreme than anyone admits.**
- It's not 80/20. It's 98/2.
- Top 5% of funds generate 60% of all VC returns
- If you're not in the top 5%, you're wasting your time

**3. Bigger is not better. It's worse.**
- Inverse correlation between fund size and returns
- Once you cross $200M, consistent 4x+ returns are nearly impossible
- Mega-funds are a fee-extraction business, not a returns business

**4. Emerging managers have a real edge.**
- First-time funds outperform by 4-6% annually
- But only 11% of capital goes to them
- This is a massive market inefficiency

**5. LPs make irrational decisions.**
- Cluster into brand-name funds that underperform
- Avoid emerging managers who outperform
- Why? Career risk > returns
- "I won't get fired for investing in Sequoia"

**6. Track record is everything.**
- If you can't show 3+ wins, you won't raise
- "I worked at [top firm]" doesn't count
- "I sourced [unicorn]" does count

**7. The best time to raise is right after a crash.**
- 2024-2026 is a golden vintage (post-ZIRP crash)
- Valuations reset, competition declined, discipline returned
- Historical pattern: Best funds come from crash vintages

**8. AI is oversaturated AND still early.**
- Generic "AI thesis" funds will fail
- Differentiated AI funds (infrastructure, vertical-specific) will win
- The key: Do you have a real edge, or are you just riding the narrative?

**9. For Florian / Ainary Ventures:**
- $5M Fund I is the right size
- European-US bridge is a real edge
- AI infrastructure + vertical apps is differentiated
- Target: Family offices, funds-of-funds, solo GPs
- Proof of concept: Deploy own capital first, then raise

**10. The only way to win is to be top-decile.**
- There's no reward for being "pretty good" in VC
- Either you're exceptional or you're irrelevant
- Build the fund (and the track record) that can't be ignored

## FINAL THOUGHT

Venture capital is not a game of "invest in good companies and hope for the best."

It's a game of:
- **Access:** Can you see the best deals?
- **Selection:** Can you pick the 1% that will return 100x?
- **Ownership:** Can you own enough to matter when they succeed?
- **Support:** Can you help them win?

Most funds fail at 1-2 of these. The top funds win at all four.

If you're building a fund, the question is simple:

**Do you have an edge that will put you in the top 5%?**

If yes, raise the fund. If no, don't.

The world doesn't need another median VC fund.
