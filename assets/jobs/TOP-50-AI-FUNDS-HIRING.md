**Red Flags / Culture:** High-intensity culture. Josh Wolfe is charismatic but demanding. Long hours expected. Very thesis-driven — if you're not passionate about deep tech, it's a mismatch. Some reports of junior team churn.

**Fit Score: ★★★★★** — Your #1 target. Operator background in AI + manufacturing + deep tech + NYC = perfect.

## 2. a16z (Andreessen Horowitz)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$42B+ total |

- Their talent network events in NYC

**What Makes Them Unique:** Scale + media machine + portfolio network. Being at a16z means access to the best AI founders globally. Their platform team (marketing, recruiting, policy help for portfolio) is unmatched. "Operating experience valued" is not lip service — they built their brand on it.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Massive firm — you can get lost. Political internally. Some criticism of "spray and pray" at scale. Marc's political commentary has alienated some founders. Associate role can be heavily sourcing/grunt work at a firm this size. SF-centric culture even in NYC office.

**Fit Score: ★★★★☆** — Incredible brand and AI exposure. Your operator background fits. Downside: massive firm, less autonomy as associate. NYC office is growing but still secondary.

|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$48B (hedge fund + venture) |
| **Stage** | Growth + Late-stage venture, expanding into earlier stages |
| **Location** | NYC (HQ) + SF |
| **Website** | coatue.com |

**AI Thesis:** Data-driven, quantitative approach to AI investing. Built proprietary models to evaluate AI companies. Believes AI is a "deployment phase" story now — the winners will be companies that deploy AI into workflows, not just build models. Heavy on AI infrastructure and enterprise AI.

**What Makes Them Unique:** Hedge fund DNA means rigorous, data-driven diligence. You'll learn quantitative investing alongside venture. NYC-native. Huge check sizes mean you work on the biggest AI deals. Their proprietary analytics platform for evaluating companies is genuinely differentiated.

## 4. Felicis Ventures

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$3B+ |
| **Stage** | Seed to Series B |
| **Location** | SF (primary), distributed team |
| **Website** | felicis.com |

**AI Thesis:** "Invest in the top 1% of founders building the future." AI-horizontal approach — invest in the best AI founders regardless of vertical. Particularly strong in AI-enabled fintech, enterprise, and developer tools. Believes AI is still Day 1 and the application layer is where most value will accrue.

**Application:** felicis.com/careers | Aydin is approachable on Twitter

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- VC Lab → Aydin is known in the emerging manager ecosystem
- Turkish tech network (Aydin maintains strong ties)
- European founder network — Felicis has invested in EU companies
- TUM → Google alumni network (Aydin was early Google)

**What Makes Them Unique:** Aydin's personal network is legendary — one of the best angel portfolios in history. Smaller team means more responsibility early. Operator-friendly culture. Less bureaucratic than mega-funds.

**Red Flags / Culture:** SF-centric despite distributed claims. Smaller fund means less support infrastructure. Aydin-centric — firm identity is very tied to founder. Some perception of being "old school" in a new school market.

**Fit Score: ★★★★☆** — Great cultural fit for operator-turned-investor. Distributed model could work for NYC. Strong AI portfolio but not AI-specialist fund.

## 5. Bessemer Venture Partners

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$20B+ |
| **Stage** | Seed to Growth |
| **Location** | SF, NYC, Israel, India |
| **Website** | bvp.com |

**AI Thesis:** "Roadmap" approach — publishes detailed thematic roadmaps including AI. Believes in "AI-native" enterprise software that rebuilds entire categories. Strong conviction in vertical AI (healthcare AI, legal AI, fintech AI) over horizontal plays. Their "State of the Cloud" and AI market maps are industry benchmarks.

**Key Partners:**
- **Ethan Kurzweil** — AI/cloud enterprise. Son of Ray Kurzweil. Deep AI conviction. Based in SF.

- Their NYC office is very active in the NYC tech ecosystem
- TUM → their interest in vertical AI (especially legal AI, manufacturing) directly overlaps with your experience

**What Makes Them Unique:** 100+ year old firm with modern tech DNA. Their research publications (roadmaps, cloud index) are genuinely valuable and signal intellectual rigor. Multi-stage means you see companies from seed to IPO. NYC office is a real office, not an outpost.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Large partnership can mean slow decisions. Traditional VC culture under the modern veneer. Some partners are more collaborative than others. Structured hierarchy — associates don't get as much deal autonomy as at smaller funds.

**Fit Score: ★★★★★** — NYC office, AI thesis aligned (vertical AI!), values operator backgrounds, established brand. Your legal AI interest + manufacturing AI experience directly maps to their thesis.

## 6. Radical Ventures

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$1B+ |
| **Stage** | Seed to Series B |
| **Location** | Toronto (HQ), NYC presence |
| **Website** | radical.vc |

**AI Thesis:** Pure-play AI fund. Founded by the team around Geoffrey Hinton (Godfather of Deep Learning). Invests exclusively in AI-first companies. Thesis: AI is a general-purpose technology like electricity — invest across every application domain but only in companies where AI is the core IP, not a feature.

- **Tomi Poutanen** (Co-founder) — Technical AI background. Former IBM Watson, built AI products.

**Open Roles:** Radical has been growing and hires associates who deeply understand AI technically. They value PhDs and technical operators. NYC-friendly given their expanding US presence.

**Application:** radical.vc/careers | Small team, direct outreach to partners works

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- VC Lab → Radical is in the AI emerging manager space, natural overlap
- TUM → Toronto AI ecosystem has deep ties to European ML research community
- Geoffrey Hinton network → any ML research connections from TUM
- European AI policy circles — Radical is active in AI governance discussions

**What Makes Them Unique:** *The* AI-native fund. Hinton association gives unparalleled deal flow in AI research spinouts. If you want to be known as an "AI investor," this is the purest signal. Small team = high impact. They genuinely understand the technology at a research level.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Toronto-based, so NYC associate might feel distant. Smaller fund means less brand recognition outside AI circles. Research-heavy culture may underweight go-to-market/commercial considerations. Can be "too academic" in diligence.

**Fit Score: ★★★★★** — Your technical AI background + operator experience is exactly their gap. They have researchers; they need people who've built AI in production. VC Lab connection is strong. This is a top target.

## 7. Conviction

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$300M+ |
| **Stage** | Pre-seed to Series A |
| **Location** | NYC |
| **Website** | conviction.com |

**AI Thesis:** AI-first fund founded by Sarah Guo, former Greylock partner who left specifically to focus on AI. Thesis: we're in a "Cambrian explosion" of AI applications; the opportunity is in the application layer built on top of foundation models. Invests in AI-native companies that couldn't exist without current AI capabilities.

**Key Partners:**
- **Sarah Guo** (Founder/GP) — Former Greylock partner. Operator background (early LinkedIn). One of the most visible AI investors, runs the "No Priors" podcast with Elad Gil. Stanford CS.
- **Chenyu Zheng** — Principal, technical AI background.

**Recent AI Investments:** Harvey (legal AI), Imbue (AI agents), various stealth AI-native startups. Early and concentrated bets.

**Open Roles:** Small team, hiring selectively. Associate roles in NYC. They want people who deeply understand AI capabilities and limitations from building, not just investing.

**Application:** conviction.com | Direct outreach to Sarah (she's very active on Twitter/X)

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- VC Lab → Sarah is well-connected in the emerging manager/AI investor ecosystem
- "No Priors" podcast network — engage with content, build relationship
- NYC AI meetup scene — Conviction is active in NYC AI community
- Legal AI angle — they invested in Harvey, your legal AI experience is directly relevant

**What Makes Them Unique:** Sarah Guo is one of the most thoughtful AI investors. Small, concentrated portfolio means deep engagement. NYC-based, AI-native, operator-friendly. The "No Priors" podcast gives unique deal flow and brand.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Very early fund (Fund I/II). Small team means wearing many hats. Sarah's personal brand dominates — firm is still building institutional identity. Concentrated portfolio is risky for learning breadth.

**Fit Score: ★★★★★** — NYC, AI-native, values operators, invested in legal AI. Your Harvey-adjacent experience + production AI + fundraising background = ideal. Top 3 target.

---

## 8. Elad Gil (via fund)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$1B+ across vehicles |
| **Stage** | Seed to Series B |
| **Location** | SF (primary) |

**AI Thesis:** AI is the "biggest technology shift in decades." Invests in AI infrastructure, models, and applications. Extremely concentrated, high-conviction bets. Believes in backing repeat founders and technical teams building AI-native products. Co-hosts "No Priors" podcast with Sarah Guo.

**Key Team:** Elad Gil is essentially a solo GP with a small support team. He hires investment team members selectively.

**Recent AI Investments:** Perplexity AI, Mistral, Harvey, various AI infra companies. Known for getting into the best AI rounds.

**Open Roles:** Rarely hires, but when he does, it's for someone deeply technical who can evaluate AI companies. Worth monitoring.

**Application:** Direct outreach via Twitter/X or mutual connections

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- "No Priors" podcast connection → Sarah Guo at Conviction (see #7)
- VC Lab network
- His book "High Growth Handbook" community
- Y Combinator network (he's YC-adjacent)

**What Makes Them Unique:** Access to the absolute best AI deals. Elad's personal brand and network are unmatched. Working with him is an apprenticeship with one of Silicon Valley's most connected operators.

**Red Flags / Culture:** SF-only likely. Solo GP = everything depends on one person. Not a "traditional" associate role — more like chief of staff. Limited institutional learning compared to a partnership.

**Fit Score: ★★★☆☆** — SF-based is a challenge, but if he hires in NYC, jump immediately. Worth building the relationship regardless.

## 9. Index Ventures

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$11B+ |
| **Stage** | Seed to Growth |
| **Location** | SF, London, NYC (expanding) |
| **Website** | indexventures.com |

**AI Thesis:** European-rooted, global fund. Believes in backing "category-defining" AI companies. Strong in AI developer tools, infrastructure, and enterprise AI.

**Recent AI Investments:** Mistral AI (co-led), Cohere, Scale AI, Notion (AI features), Datadog (growth), various European AI companies.

**Open Roles:** Index hires across SF, London, and NYC. They specifically value European backgrounds — your TUM/Munich profile is an asset. Associate and principal roles.

**Application:** indexventures.com/careers | Strong campus recruiting from top EU/US schools

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- TUM → Index actively scouts European technical talent
- Munich tech ecosystem → Index has invested in German/EU companies
- VC Lab → Index is well-known in the emerging manager space
- London tech network as a bridge (Index London office)

**What Makes Them Unique:** Best of both worlds — European DNA with Silicon Valley scale. Your European + US positioning is exactly their associate profile. They genuinely value international backgrounds. Multi-stage means broad learning. One of the best-performing funds globally.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Large partnership, complex dynamics. European offices sometimes feel secondary to SF. Junior roles can involve heavy sourcing in specific geo. Competitive internal culture for deal attribution.

**Fit Score: ★★★★★** — Your European technical background + US ambition is literally their pitch. TUM + Munich + AI production experience + fundraising = perfect profile. Top 3 target.

## 10. Wing Venture Capital

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$1.5B |

| **Location** | Palo Alto, CA |

**Recent AI Investments:** Robust Intelligence (AI security), Weights & Biases (early), various enterprise AI infrastructure plays.

**Open Roles:** Small team but hires associates with enterprise + technical backgrounds. Primarily SF/Palo Alto.

**Application:** wing.vc/careers | Small enough for direct partner outreach

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- Enterprise AI angle — your production AI experience in manufacturing
- VC Lab → Wing partners speak at enterprise-focused events
- Your fundraising experience (raised €5.5M) — they're operators who respect operators

**What Makes Them Unique:** Every partner has been a founder or enterprise executive. They don't just invest — they roll up sleeves operationally. "Built by operators, for operators" is genuine here, not marketing. Deep enterprise AI focus with real technical diligence.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Palo Alto-based, less NYC-friendly. Smaller brand than mega-funds. Enterprise focus may feel narrow. Limited consumer/frontier AI exposure.

**Fit Score: ★★★★☆** — Thesis alignment is excellent (enterprise AI + operator backgrounds). Location is the challenge. Worth pursuing if they expand to NYC or go hybrid.

## 11. Madrona Ventures

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$3B+ |
| **Stage** | Seed to Series B |
| **Location** | Seattle, WA |
| **Website** | madrona.com |

**AI Thesis:** AI-infrastructure thesis born from proximity to Microsoft/Amazon. Believes in the "AI stack" — invests across foundation models, infrastructure, tooling, and applications.

**Open Roles:** Madrona hires associates and VPs, primarily Seattle-based. Technical backgrounds strongly preferred.

**Application:** madrona.com/careers | Active on LinkedIn recruiting

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- Microsoft/Amazon ecosystem connections
- VC Lab → Madrona is active in the venture education space
- Their AI research publications can be an engagement point
- Seattle-based AI meetups (remote engagement possible)

**What Makes Them Unique:** Unmatched access to Microsoft/Amazon AI ecosystem. Their enterprise AI deal flow is differentiated by geography and relationships. Soma's Microsoft network alone generates proprietary deals. Smaller than coastal mega-funds but punches way above weight.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Seattle-based — not NYC-friendly. Regional fund perception (though portfolio is national). Junior team has historically been small. Less brand recognition on the coasts.

**Fit Score: ★★★☆☆** — Great thesis fit, but Seattle location is a challenge. Worth building relationship for potential remote or NYC expansion.

---

## 12. FirstMark Capital

| Field | Detail |

- NYC tech scene — FirstMark IS the NYC tech scene via Guild
- VC Lab → Rick Heitzmann is known in the broader VC community
- Matt Turck's AI/Data landscape work — engage with his content
- Attend Guild events for natural networking

**What Makes Them Unique:** Most connected fund in the NYC tech ecosystem. Guild events give unmatched access to NYC founders. Rick's community approach means the firm has incredible deal flow through relationships, not cold outreach. NYC-native fund with genuine AI conviction.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Generalist fund that does AI, not AI-specialist. May not go as deep technically as pure AI funds. Community management can be time-consuming for juniors (Guild event coordination). Some key team changes in recent years.

**Fit Score: ★★★★★** — NYC-native, community-driven, AI-aware. Perfect for building your NYC network while investing in AI. Your operator + community background from VC Lab is ideal.

## 13. Greylock Partners

| **Website** | greylock.com |

**AI Thesis:** "Products, not projects." Invests in AI that becomes a product people use daily, not science experiments. Strong conviction in AI developer tools, enterprise AI, and consumer AI.

- **Seth Rosenberg** — AI/developer tools. Technical background.
- **Saam Motamedi** — Enterprise AI. Led investments in Figma, Coda.

**Application:** greylock.com/careers | Reid Hoffman accessible via LinkedIn (obviously)

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- LinkedIn/Reid Hoffman network — any connections there
- VC Lab → Greylock is well-known in the venture ecosystem
- "Blitzscaling" book/course community (Reid's Stanford course)
- AI content engagement (Greylock has strong content practice)

**What Makes Them Unique:** Reid Hoffman's AI conviction and Microsoft board seat give unique insight into the AI landscape. Small partnership = concentrated, high-conviction bets. "Compound startup" thesis is differentiated and genuinely insightful.

**Red Flags / Culture:** SF-centric. Post-Sarah Guo, the AI practice is still re-forming. Smaller team means fewer openings. Reid is less active day-to-day. Can feel like "past its prime" compared to newer AI-native funds.

**Fit Score: ★★★★☆** — Strong AI thesis, legendary brand. SF location is a challenge but worth pursuing for the learning and network.

## 14. AIX Ventures

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **AUM** | ~$200M+ |
| **Stage** | Pre-seed to Seed |
| **Location** | SF + distributed |
| **Website** | aix.vc |

**AI Thesis:** Pure-play AI fund focused on the earliest stages. Invests in AI researchers and technical founders spinning out of labs (Google Brain, DeepMind, FAIR, university labs).

**Warm Intro Paths:**
- TUM ML/AI research connections
- VC Lab → emerging manager network
- AI research community (conferences like NeurIPS, ICML)

**What Makes Them Unique:** One of the few funds operating at the intersection of AI research and venture capital. If you want to invest in frontier AI from day zero, this is the place.

**Red Flags / Culture:** Very small, very early fund. Limited brand. Might be too research-focused for someone with operator/commercial background. SF-based.

**Fit Score: ★★★☆☆** — Interesting for pure AI thesis alignment but may undervalue your operator experience. Keep on radar.

**Open Roles:** NEA hires associates in NYC, Menlo Park, and DC. Structured associate program. NYC office is well-staffed.

**Application:** nea.com/careers | Formal recruiting cycle

## ⚠️ Final Notes

1. **This document reflects training knowledge through early 2025.** Team compositions, AUM, and open roles change. Verify before applying.
2. **Partner movements are common in VC.** Confirm partners are still at listed funds.
3. **AUM figures are approximate** and may not reflect latest fund closings.
4. **"Red flags" are informed opinions**, not insider knowledge. Form your own judgment.
5. **The best way in is always a warm intro.** VC Lab / Decile Group is your strongest lever — use it aggressively.
6. **Your unique angle: operator who built AI in production + European technical education + US ambition + VC Lab credentials.** Very few candidates have this combination. Lead with it.
