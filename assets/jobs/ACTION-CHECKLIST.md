## 💪 CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS

**When imposter syndrome hits, remember:**

1. You raised €5.5M+ across two companies
2. You built production AI systems (not just demos)
3. You led a 150-person organization
4. You're CURRENTLY building a fund (not dreaming about it)
5. You have technical depth most VCs lack
6. You've been both founder and operator (rare)

**You're not "trying to break into VC"—you're already doing the job.**
