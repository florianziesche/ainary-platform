## 🚨 RISK FACTORS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: "Not Enough VC Experience"
**Mitigation:**
- Frame as "I've been doing VC work—just not with the title"
- Emphasize VC Lab training + fund building
- Show deal evaluations, thesis memos from VC Lab

### Risk 2: "Location Mismatch" (Some roles are SF/Remote)
**Mitigation:**
- For SF roles: Express willingness to relocate OR pitch NYC hub
- For remote roles: Emphasize NYC as asset (local deal flow)
- Prioritize NYC-based roles (5 available)

### Risk 3: "Overqualified" (Too senior for Associate roles)
**Mitigation:**
- Frame as "hungry to learn institutional VC"
- Emphasize apprenticeship mindset
- Show willingness to start at associate level for right fund

### Risk 4: "Too Founder-y" (VCs worry founders can't be team players)
**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize COO experience (not just CEO = can take direction)
- Show team player mentality via 36ZERO Vision leadership
- VC Lab = proof of institutional alignment

## 🎉 FINAL THOUGHTS

**You did it, Florian.**

You've gone from "I need a job" to "I have 10 perfect targets, tailored pitches, and a clear action plan" in one research sprint.

**What makes this search different:**
- You're not "breaking into VC"—you're already building a fund
- You're not a career switcher—you're a founder who's scaling his investor lens
- You're not competing with bankers—you're bringing something they can't: operator + technical + investor in one package

**The only question is: Which offer will you accept?**

Now go apply. The roles are real, the links are live, and the funds are hiring.

**Your move.**
