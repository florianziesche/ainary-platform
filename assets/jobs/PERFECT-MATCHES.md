## 🎯 WHY FLORIAN IS 10/10

### Rare Combo
- **Operator** (CEO/COO, 150-person org, P&L owner)
- **Technical** (Built RAG, agentic AI, can code)
- **Business** (Raised €5.5M equity + €1.5M grants)
- **Investor** (Building Ainary Ventures via VC Lab)

### Unicorn Traits
1. **Both sides of the table** - Raised as founder + raising as fund manager
2. **Actually built AI** - Not just invested in it or read about it
3. **Vertical AI depth** - Legal tech + manufacturing software = rare domain knowledge
4. **Transatlantic bridge** - European (German) + US (NYC-based) network
5. **Governance mindset** - Understands AI responsibility (matches emerging VC thesis)

### Edge Over Other Candidates
- Most associates: Banking/consulting → VC (no operator experience)
- Most principals: 1-2 startups → VC (limited technical depth)
- **Florian**: CEO + COO + Technical + Fund-building = complete package

## 💡 BONUS: ALTERNATIVE PATHS

If VC roles don't materialize immediately, these are 10/10 lateral moves:

1. **Head of AI at growth-stage startup** (Series B/C)
   - Search: "Head of AI" + "Series B" + NYC
   - Leverage: Technical + business + fundraising experience

2. **Chief of Staff to VC GP**
   - Rare but perfect fit for operator background
   - Network-dependent (ask VC Lab mentors)

3. **Operating Partner at PE/VC**
   - Portfolio support role = plays to operator strengths
   - Less common at early-stage, more at growth/PE
