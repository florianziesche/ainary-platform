## How to Maximize Event ROI

**10 Tactical Tips for Emerging Managers at Conferences**

### 1. **Pre-Event Reconnaissance (2 weeks before)**
- Research attendee list (if available) and identify 20 target LPs/GPs
- Send brief, personalized outreach: "Will you be at [event]? Would love to connect for 15 min"
- Book 60% of your calendar before you arrive
- Create a simple tracking sheet: Name | Company | Priority | Status | Follow-up

### 2. **Craft Your 30-Second Pitch (The "Elevator Edit")**
Your intro should answer: Who are you? What do you invest in? What makes you different?

**Example:** "I'm Sarah, raising a $20M seed fund focused on vertical AI in healthcare. We're former operators from Epic and Tempus who understand clinical workflows. Looking for LPs who want exposure to regulated AI markets."

**Not:** "I'm raising a fund. We invest in tech. We're looking for capital."

### 3. **The "Conference Uniform" Strategy**
- Wear something distinctive but professional (colorful blazer, unique glasses, patterned shirt)
- People will remember "the person in the blue jacket" when following up
- Continuity: Wear the same outfit both days so people recognize you across sessions

### 4. **Master the "Double Opt-In" Ask**
Never ask for a meeting on the spot. Instead:
- **Wrong:** "Can we meet next Tuesday at 2pm?"
- **Right:** "This is fascinating. Mind if I send a calendar invite next week to continue the conversation?"

Reduces pressure, increases yes rate. Follow up within 24 hours.

### 5. **The "5-3-1" Engagement Model**
- **5 deep conversations** (30+ min) with target LPs or co-investors
- **3 panel Q&As** where you ask a smart, memorable question from the audience
- **1 side event** (dinner, drinks, exclusive gathering) — these drive 10x value of floor time

Skip the crowded main floor. Hunt for side events and hosted dinners.

### 6. **Live Documentation (The "Notes Hack")**
- Take notes during conversations: "Mind if I jot this down?"
- Shows you're serious and helps retention
- Use notes to craft personalized follow-ups later
- Tool: Notion mobile app, Apple Notes, or simple index cards

### 7. **The Strategic No-Show**
Don't attend every session. Use conference downtime to:
- Write same-day follow-ups (while memory is fresh)
- Take intro calls with people who couldn't attend
- Rest (exhaustion kills your edge)

**Best use of time:** Skip the keynote everyone will talk about. Use that hour for 1:1s.

### 8. **Content Creation On-Site**
- Take photos with speakers/investors (post on LinkedIn with thoughtful caption)
- Live-tweet insights from sessions (tag speakers, use event hashtag)
- Record short "key takeaway" videos in hotel room each night
- Publish a recap blog post within 48 hours

**Why:** Positions you as thought leader, extends your reach beyond who you met.

### 9. **The "Giving First" Approach**
Lead with value, not asks:
- "I saw you're hiring an associate—I met someone great at the last session. Want an intro?"
- "You mentioned X challenge—I have a framework we use that might help. I'll send it over."
- "I'm organizing a small dinner next week with 3 other emerging managers. Join us?"

Build social capital first. Ask for the meeting second.

### 10. **The 48-Hour Follow-Up Blitz**
Most people follow up weeks later (or never). You follow up within 48 hours:

**Email template:**
```
Subject: Great meeting you at [Event] — [one specific thing you discussed]

Hi [Name],

Really enjoyed our conversation about [specific detail] at [Event]. 

[One insight or value add related to your conversation]

Would love to continue the discussion. Are you open to a 20-minute call in the next two weeks? 

Here's my calendar: [link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Include:**
- Specific detail from your conversation (proves you remember)
- One piece of value (article, intro, insight)
- Easy next step (calendar link, not vague "let's chat")

## Event Selection Framework

**Not all events are created equal. Here's how to choose:**

| Event Type | Best For | Skip If |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **Large Conferences (5K+ people)** | Brand building, content creation, serendipity | You need immediate capital—too diffuse |
| **LP-Focused Summits** | Fundraising mode, building LP pipeline | Not actively raising or don't have track record |
| **Regional Ecosystem Events** | Local deal flow, building community | Not investing in that geography |
| **Academic/Research Conferences** | Deep tech, frontier technology, technical diligence | Investing in B2B SaaS, consumer apps |
| **Demo Days** | Sourcing, early-stage deal flow | Later-stage growth investor |
| **Invite-Only Gatherings** | High-quality networking, decision-makers | Early in career—earn your way in first |

**Emerging Manager Priority (Fundraising Mode):**
1. LP-focused events (SuperReturn, ILPA Summit)
2. Emerging manager-specific (Decile, First Close)
3. Regional ecosystem events (where you invest)
4. Large brand-building conferences (1-2 per year max)

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Average Cost per Event:**
- Conference ticket: $1,000-$3,500
- Flights & hotel: $800-$1,500
- Meals & transportation: $200-$500
- **Total: $2,000-$5,500 per event**

**Expected ROI (Realistic):**
- 20 meaningful conversations
- 5 follow-up meetings scheduled
- 2 second meetings
- 1 potential LP relationship (10% close rate)

**Break-even:** One LP commit from one event covers 20+ events. Play the long game.

## Event Budget Template for Emerging Managers

**Annual Event Budget Recommendation: $15,000-$25,000**

| Category | # Events | Budget |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Tier 1: Must-Attend LP Events** | 2-3 | $8,000-$12,000 |
| **Tier 2: Ecosystem/Brand Building** | 2-3 | $4,000-$7,000 |
| **Tier 3: Regional/Niche** | 3-5 | $3,000-$6,000 |

**Budget Hacks:**
- Volunteer/speaker = free pass (offer to moderate a panel)
- Early bird tickets (30-50% savings)
- Emerging manager discounts (ask for scholarship/diversity tickets)
- Skip accommodation—commute if local or Airbnb (50% savings)
- Attend only Day 2 (networking day, skip Day 1 panels)

---

## Virtual Event Strategy

**Virtual events are underrated for emerging managers:**

**Pros:**
- Zero travel cost
- Attend multiple on same day
- Record conversations/sessions
- Lower barrier to ask for follow-up (less intimidating)

**Cons:**
- Harder to build deep relationships
- Zoom fatigue
- Easier to be forgotten

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Attend 6-8 in-person events per year
- Supplement with 10+ virtual events
- Use virtual to build pipeline, in-person to close

---

## Conclusion

**The Emerging Manager Event Playbook:**
1. **Choose strategically** — Quality > Quantity
2. **Prepare like a pro** — Pre-event outreach changes everything
3. **Be distinctive** — Memorable beats present
4. **Give first** — Value before asks
5. **Follow up fast** — 48 hours, not 2 weeks
6. **Track everything** — CRM your event pipeline
7. **Content leverage** — Turn attendance into reach
8. **Play the long game** — Relationships compound over years

**Most Important:** Events are not where deals happen. They're where relationships start. The real work happens in the 6 months of follow-up afterward.
