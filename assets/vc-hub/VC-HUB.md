- **Consumer-only strategies** (unless exceptional track record)
- **Funds >$500M** unless top-quartile brand (Sequoia, a16z, Accel tier)
- **Crypto-exclusive funds** (though crypto allocation within broader tech fund is acceptable)
- **Funds that raised in 2021-2022** at inflated management fees (2.5%+)

#### **Fundraising Timeline:**
- **First-time funds:** 12-18 months to first close (2025)
- **Established funds (Fund II-IV):** 6-12 months
- **Top-tier brands:** 3-6 months (oversubscribed)

#### **Emerging Manager Landscape:**
- **Opportunity:** Large institutional LPs reducing check count = space for emerging managers
- **Challenge:** Higher diligence bar — need 5-10 strong angel investments as proof
- **Trend:** Solo GPs and micro-funds ($5M-$25M) gaining traction
- **Access:** Platforms like Allocate, Screendoor democratizing LP access for smaller funds

#### **Geographic Focus Shifts:**
- **US:** Still dominant, but valuation discipline returning
- **Europe:** Growing interest, especially London, Berlin, Stockholm — "better value" perception
- **Asia:** Selective; India SaaS hot, China pullback continues
- **Emerging Markets:** LatAm (especially Brazil, Mexico) gaining momentum in fintech

#### **Fund Terms Evolution:**
- **Management Fees:** Returning to 2% standard (down from 2.5% in 2021)
- **Carry:** 20% remains standard; 25% for top-tier only
- **Fund Life:** 10+2 standard; some extending to 10+3 due to longer exit timelines
- **GP Commit:** 2-5% expected (higher for emerging managers to show skin in the game)

### **Actionable Insights for Fundraising Founders (2025-2026):**

1. **AI Narrative Required** — Even non-AI companies should articulate AI strategy/usage
2. **Show Path to Profitability** — "Growth at all costs" dead; unit economics critical from Seed onwards
3. **Smaller Rounds, More Milestones** — Raise 18-24 months runway, not 36+ months
4. **European LPs More Accessible** — Consider transatlantic fundraising for better terms
5. **Warm Intros Essential** — Cold emails <2% success rate; leverage scouts, angels, portfolio founders
6. **Stage Compression** — What was "Series A" in 2020 is now "Seed" in metrics expectations
