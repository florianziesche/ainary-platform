# FOUNDER TEMPLATES PACK

30 essential startup templates to copy, adapt, and ship faster.

---

## 📊 FINANCIAL (5 Templates)

### 1. Financial Model

**Category:** Financial  
**Key Sections:** Revenue streams, Cost structure, Cash flow projection, Break-even analysis, Scenario planning

**Example Content:**
```
Revenue: SaaS subscriptions ($99/mo × 150 customers = $14.9K MRR)
Costs: Engineering (40%), Sales/Marketing (30%), Operations (20%), Buffer (10%)
Runway: 18 months at current burn, break-even at 500 customers (Month 14)
```

**Why It Matters:** Your financial model is your business in numbers. It forces clarity on unit economics, reveals whether the business can actually work, and shows investors you understand the path to profitability.

**Common Mistake:** Building a bottom-up model that ignores market reality. Your spreadsheet says you'll have 10,000 customers in Year 2, but the total addressable market only has 2,000 potential buyers.

---

### 2. Cap Table

**Category:** Financial  
**Key Sections:** Shareholder register, Ownership percentages, Option pool, Waterfall analysis, Dilution scenarios

**Example Content:**
```
Founders: Alice (45%), Bob (35%), Carol (10%)
Investors: Seed Fund (10% for $500K at $4.5M post)
Option Pool: 10% (pre-money) reserved for first 10 hires
```

**Why It Matters:** Your cap table is the single source of truth for who owns what. Mess this up early and you'll spend years (and legal fees) untangling it. Clean cap tables close rounds faster.

**Common Mistake:** Not reserving an option pool before raising. Investors will demand 10-15% for employees, and if you don't create it pre-money, it comes entirely out of founder equity.

---

### 3. Unit Economics

**Category:** Financial  
**Key Sections:** CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), LTV (Lifetime Value), Payback period, Gross margin, Cohort analysis

**Example Content:**
```
CAC: $400 (marketing spend ÷ new customers)
LTV: $2,400 (ARPU × avg customer lifespan × gross margin)
LTV:CAC Ratio: 6:1 (healthy SaaS benchmark: 3:1 or better)
```

**Why It Matters:** Unit economics determine if you have a viable business or a leaky bucket. You can't scale your way out of negative unit economics—you'll just lose money faster.

**Common Mistake:** Calculating LTV using current retention rates when you've only been live for 3 months. Early retention is always higher—true LTV emerges after 12-18 months.

---

### 4. Burn Rate Calculator

**Category:** Financial  
**Key Sections:** Monthly expenses by category, Revenue vs. burn, Runway calculation, Funding timeline, Cash flow alerts

**Example Content:**
```
Monthly burn: $85K (payroll $50K, cloud $10K, marketing $15K, ops $10K)
Current runway: 14 months ($1.2M in bank ÷ $85K burn)
Raise trigger: Month 8 (need 6 months to close round + 6 months buffer)
```

**Why It Matters:** Running out of cash is the #1 reason startups die. Tracking burn rate isn't paranoia—it's survival. You should know your runway down to the week.

**Common Mistake:** Forgetting to include one-time expenses or lumpy costs (annual software licenses, tax payments, year-end bonuses) that spike your burn in certain months.

---

### 5. Revenue Forecast

**Category:** Financial  
**Key Sections:** Growth assumptions, Revenue drivers, Conversion funnel, Expansion revenue, Churn impact

**Example Content:**
```
Month 1: 100 users × $49 ARPU = $4.9K MRR
Month 6: 400 users × $52 ARPU (expansion) = $20.8K MRR
Month 12: 850 users × $55 ARPU = $46.8K MRR (accounting for 3% monthly churn)
```

**Why It Matters:** Forecasts force you to articulate your growth assumptions and stress-test whether they're realistic. They also align the team around a shared target.

**Common Mistake:** Forecasting revenue in a vacuum without connecting it to specific activities. "We'll grow 20% MoM" means nothing without a plan for *how*: ads, content, sales calls, partnerships.

---

## 💰 FUNDRAISING (5 Templates)

### 6. Investor Update

**Category:** Fundraising  
**Key Sections:** Headline metrics, Key wins, Challenges/asks, Financials snapshot, Next milestones

**Example Content:**
```
Metrics: MRR $28K (+18% MoM), 340 customers (+45), NRR 115%
Win: Closed enterprise pilot with Fortune 500 co ($50K ARR)
Ask: Intros to Head of Sales at Stripe, Notion, or similar PLG companies
```

**Why It Matters:** Monthly investor updates keep your cap table warm, build trust through transparency, and prime investors for your next round. Founders who send updates raise faster.

**Common Mistake:** Only sending updates when things are going well. Investors expect challenges—hiding them destroys credibility. Share the struggle, ask for help, and show how you're addressing it.

---

### 7. Data Room Checklist

**Category:** Fundraising  
**Key Sections:** Corporate docs, Financial records, Product/tech, Legal/IP, Customer data, HR/team

**Example Content:**
```
Corporate: Certificate of incorporation, bylaws, cap table, board minutes
Financial: Financial model, bank statements (12mo), tax returns, current budget
Legal: Material contracts, IP assignments, compliance docs (GDPR, SOC2 if applicable)
```

**Why It Matters:** A clean, organized data room signals professionalism and speeds up diligence. Scrambling to find documents during diligence kills momentum and raises red flags.

**Common Mistake:** Waiting until diligence starts to build your data room. Assemble it *before* you start fundraising—it'll surface issues early and keep deal velocity high.

---

### 8. Term Sheet Comparison

**Category:** Fundraising  
**Key Sections:** Valuation & economics, Investor rights, Governance terms, Liquidation preferences, Pro-rata & anti-dilution

**Example Content:**
```
Fund A: $5M post, 1x non-participating pref, board seat, standard pro-rata
Fund B: $6M post, 1x participating pref, board observer, super pro-rata (2x)
Effective valuation after liquidation pref: Fund A = better for founder
```

**Why It Matters:** Not all term sheets are equal. A higher valuation with onerous terms can leave you worse off. This template helps you compare apples-to-apples and negotiate smartly.

**Common Mistake:** Optimizing only for valuation. Participating preferred, board composition, and protective provisions can cost you millions on exit—especially in modest outcomes ($20-50M).

---

### 9. Investor CRM

**Category:** Fundraising  
**Key Sections:** Investor name/fund, Stage/check size, Status (cold/warm/meeting/diligence), Last contact, Next steps, Notes

**Example Content:**
```
Jane Doe | Seed Fund XYZ | $500K-$1M checks | Warm (intro from Sarah)
Last contact: Jan 15 (sent deck) | Next: Follow-up Feb 1 with traction update
Notes: Loves vertical SaaS, wants to see $20K MRR before deep dive
```

**Why It Matters:** Fundraising is a pipeline, not a lottery. Tracking every conversation, warm intro, and follow-up keeps you organized and prevents leads from going cold.

**Common Mistake:** Treating fundraising as transactional. Investors back founders they *know*, not decks they saw once. Nurture relationships over months, not days.

---

### 10. Pitch Follow-Up Template

**Category:** Fundraising  
**Key Sections:** Thank you, Meeting recap, Key questions answered, Next steps, Attachments/links

**Example Content:**
```
Subject: Thanks for the meeting—[Company] follow-up

Hi [Name], great meeting you yesterday. Quick recap:
- You asked about CAC: Currently $420, targeting $350 by Q3 via content + referrals
- Deck + financial model attached
- Next: Let's sync next week after you discuss with partners?
```

**Why It Matters:** Speed signals conviction. A crisp follow-up within 24 hours keeps momentum high, answers objections while fresh, and shows you're organized.

**Common Mistake:** Sending a generic "thanks for your time" email. Investors meet 10 startups a week—your follow-up should be a *reminder* of why you're different and what they should do next.

---

## ⚙️ OPERATIONS (5 Templates)

### 11. OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)

**Category:** Operations  
**Key Sections:** Objective (qualitative goal), Key Results (3-5 measurable outcomes), Initiatives (how), Owner, Timeline

**Example Content:**
```
Objective: Become the go-to tool for early-stage SaaS finance
KR1: Reach $50K MRR (currently $28K)
KR2: Achieve NPS of 50+ (currently 42)
KR3: Publish 12 high-quality finance guides (currently 3)
```

**Why It Matters:** OKRs align the team around what matters most. They prevent drift, clarify priorities, and create accountability. Good OKRs are ambitious but achievable.

**Common Mistake:** Writing OKRs that are just tasks ("Launch new feature") instead of outcomes ("Increase activation rate by 15%"). OKRs measure impact, not activity.

---

### 12. Board Deck Template

**Category:** Operations  
**Key Sections:** Headline metrics, Progress vs. plan, Deep dive (one topic), Financials, Asks, Appendix

**Example Content:**
```
Slide 1: Dashboard (MRR, customers, burn, runway)
Slide 2: Last quarter wins (enterprise pilot, new hire, product launch)
Slide 3: Deep dive—Why our sales cycle is 60 days and how we're shortening it
Slide 4: Financials (P&L, cash, forecast)
Slide 5: Asks (intros, hiring help, strategic advice on X)
```

**Why It Matters:** Board meetings are your forcing function to step back, reflect, and get strategic input. A tight deck keeps meetings productive and ensures you get the help you need.

**Common Mistake:** Presenting 40 slides of operational detail. Board members want context, key decisions, and where they can help—not a weekly standup in slide form.

---

### 13. Weekly Metrics Dashboard

**Category:** Operations  
**Key Sections:** North Star metric, Revenue metrics, Product metrics, Growth metrics, Team/ops metrics

**Example Content:**
```
North Star: Weekly Active Users (WAU): 1,240 (+8% WoW)
Revenue: MRR $31K (+$2.1K), Churn 2.8% (target <3%)
Product: Activation rate 45% (up from 42%), P95 load time 1.2s
Growth: 340 signups (+12%), CAC $385 (down from $420)
```

**Why It Matters:** What gets measured gets managed. A weekly dashboard keeps the team focused on leading indicators and surfaces problems before they become crises.

**Common Mistake:** Tracking vanity metrics (total users, page views) instead of actionable metrics (activation rate, retention, revenue per cohort). Pick metrics you can actually influence.

---

### 14. Decision Log

**Category:** Operations  
**Key Sections:** Decision, Date, Context, Options considered, Why we chose X, Owner, Outcome (to revisit)

**Example Content:**
```
Decision: Go bottom-up PLG vs. top-down enterprise sales
Date: Jan 2026
Context: Limited runway (12mo), no enterprise sales experience on team
Options: 1) Hire VP Sales, 2) PLG with SDR layer, 3) Pure self-serve
Chose: Option 3—fastest path to product-market fit, capital efficient
```

**Why It Matters:** Decision logs create institutional memory and prevent rehashing the same debates. They also help new hires understand *why* things are the way they are.

**Common Mistake:** Only documenting decisions that worked out. Log everything significant—especially the hard calls. Failed decisions teach as much as successful ones.

---

### 15. One-Page Strategy

**Category:** Operations  
**Key Sections:** Mission, Target customer, Value prop, Moat, 12-month goals, What we're *not* doing

**Example Content:**
```
Mission: Make financial planning accessible to every early-stage founder
Customer: Pre-seed to Series A founders, <10 employees, raised <$2M
Value prop: Financial clarity in 5 minutes, not 5 spreadsheets
Moat: Community + content (SEO) + simple UX = compounding distribution
Not doing: Enterprise, agencies, or feature bloat (no BI, no custom dashboards—yet)
```

**Why It Matters:** A one-pager forces brutal clarity. It's your "strategy on a napkin"—what you're building, for whom, and how you'll win. Reference it before every big decision.

**Common Mistake:** Writing a strategy doc that tries to be everything to everyone. Strategy is about *choices*—what you won't do is as important as what you will.

---

## 👥 HIRING (5 Templates)

### 16. Job Description Template

**Category:** Hiring  
**Key Sections:** Role summary, Responsibilities, Requirements (must-have vs. nice-to-have), What we offer, How to apply

**Example Content:**
```
Role: Founding Engineer
You'll: Own product architecture, ship features end-to-end, mentor future hires
Must-have: 3+ years full-stack (React/Node), shipped production SaaS, startup DNA
Nice-to-have: Fintech experience, design chops, open-source contributions
We offer: $120-160K + 0.5-1.5% equity, remote-first, build-from-scratch greenfield
```

**Why It Matters:** Your JD is your first pitch to candidates. A clear, honest, compelling JD attracts the right people and filters out the wrong ones before you waste interview time.

**Common Mistake:** Writing generic job descriptions that could apply to any company. Be specific about your stage, culture, and what makes this role unique. Boring JDs attract boring candidates.

---

### 17. Interview Scorecard

**Category:** Hiring  
**Key Sections:** Competencies to assess, Rating scale (1-4), Evidence/examples, Overall recommendation, Concerns

**Example Content:**
```
Technical ability: 4/4 (shipped similar system at Scale Inc, clean code sample)
Ownership: 3/4 (good examples, but mostly within existing structure—not 0→1)
Communication: 4/4 (clear, concise, asked great questions)
Recommendation: Strong yes—best technical fit so far, slight concern on ambiguity tolerance
```

**Why It Matters:** Scorecards eliminate bias, create structured evaluation, and make it easier to compare candidates. They also force interviewers to assess what actually matters.

**Common Mistake:** Interviewing without a scorecard and making gut-feel decisions. Gut feel optimizes for "people like me," not "people who'll crush this role."

---

### 18. Offer Letter Template

**Category:** Hiring  
**Key Sections:** Role & start date, Compensation (salary + equity), Benefits, Employment terms, Contingencies, Acceptance deadline

**Example Content:**
```
Role: Senior Engineer, Full-time, Remote
Compensation: $140K salary + 1.2% equity (ISO options, 4yr vest, 1yr cliff)
Benefits: Health/dental/vision, unlimited PTO, $1K/yr learning budget
At-will employment, contingent on background check
Please sign by Feb 15, 2026
```

**Why It Matters:** The offer letter is a legal document and a final selling moment. It should be clear, fair, and reinforce why this is a great opportunity.

**Common Mistake:** Verbally agreeing to terms without documenting them. Always send a written offer—it protects both parties and prevents misunderstandings.

---

### 19. 90-Day Onboarding Plan

**Category:** Hiring  
**Key Sections:** Week 1-4 (learn), Week 5-8 (contribute), Week 9-12 (own), Success metrics, Check-in cadence

**Example Content:**
```
Week 1-4: Ship first PR, complete product walkthrough, meet every team member, shadow 5 customer calls
Week 5-8: Own one small feature end-to-end, improve onboarding flow, present at all-hands
Week 9-12: Lead sprint planning, ship major feature, start mentoring next hire
Success: Shipped 2 features, independently owns domain, team trusts them
```

**Why It Matters:** Great onboarding turns good hires into productive contributors fast. A structured 90-day plan sets expectations, builds confidence, and surfaces issues early.

**Common Mistake:** "Figure it out" onboarding. New hires want structure, not sink-or-swim chaos. Even senior hires need context, relationships, and early wins.

---

### 20. Equity Explainer (For Candidates)

**Category:** Hiring  
**Key Sections:** What you're getting (% and shares), How vesting works, Scenarios (exit values), Strike price, What dilution means

**Example Content:**
```
You're receiving: 1.0% (100K options out of 10M outstanding)
Vesting: 4 years, 25% after year 1, then monthly
Strike price: $0.50/share (current 409A valuation)
Example: If we exit at $50M, your 1% = $500K (before taxes)
Dilution: Expect 15-25% dilution per funding round
```

**Why It Matters:** Most candidates don't understand equity. An explainer builds trust, manages expectations, and helps them compare offers intelligently.

**Common Mistake:** Quoting equity only in shares or percentage without context (valuation, dilution, vesting). "100K options" is meaningless without the denominator.

---

## 🚀 PRODUCT (5 Templates)

### 21. PRD (Product Requirements Doc)

**Category:** Product  
**Key Sections:** Problem, User stories, Requirements (must/should/could), Design mocks, Success metrics, Open questions

**Example Content:**
```
Problem: Users abandon signup at payment step (68% drop-off)
User story: As a new user, I want to try the product before paying, so I can see value first
Must-have: 14-day free trial (no CC required), email drip during trial, upgrade prompts
Success: <30% trial-to-paid conversion, <40% drop-off at signup
```

**Why It Matters:** PRDs align product, design, and engineering around *why* we're building something and *how* we'll know it worked. They prevent scope creep and misalignment.

**Common Mistake:** Writing a PRD that's just a feature list. Good PRDs start with the problem, articulate the user benefit, and define success—features come last.

---

### 22. User Research Script

**Category:** Product  
**Key Sections:** Intro/consent, Warm-up questions, Problem exploration, Solution feedback, Wrap-up, Thank you/incentive

**Example Content:**
```
Intro: "Thanks for joining. We're learning how founders manage finances. No wrong answers—we want honest feedback."
Warm-up: "Tell me about your current role and company stage."
Problem: "Walk me through the last time you needed to forecast cash flow. What did you use? What was frustrating?"
Solution: [Show prototype] "What do you think this does? Would you use it?"
Wrap: "What's one thing we should build next?"
```

**Why It Matters:** User research is how you avoid building things nobody wants. Structured scripts ensure consistency, reduce bias, and surface real insights.

**Common Mistake:** Leading questions that validate your assumptions. Don't ask "Would you use a tool that does X?"—instead, explore their problem and see if X naturally emerges.

---

### 23. Feature Prioritization (RICE)

**Category:** Product  
**Key Sections:** Feature name, Reach (users impacted), Impact (value per user), Confidence (%), Effort (person-weeks), RICE Score

**Example Content:**
```
Feature: Email reminders for unpaid invoices
Reach: 800 users (80% of paying customers)
Impact: High (3/3)—reduces churn, increases revenue
Confidence: 80% (validated in interviews, no data yet)
Effort: 2 person-weeks
RICE Score: (800 × 3 × 0.8) / 2 = 960 → Top priority
```

**Why It Matters:** RICE forces you to quantify impact vs. effort and compare features objectively. It prevents HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) roadmaps.

**Common Mistake:** Using gut feel to prioritize or building the loudest feature request. RICE scores expose the difference between "urgent" and "important."

---

### 24. Sprint Planning Template

**Category:** Product  
**Key Sections:** Sprint goal, Capacity (team hours), Backlog items (prioritized), Task breakdown, Definition of done, Risks

**Example Content:**
```
Sprint Goal: Ship trial onboarding flow (signup → first insight in <5 min)
Capacity: 80 hours (2 engineers × 40 hrs/wk)
Backlog: [Ticket links with story points]
Definition of done: Merged to main, QA passed, analytics instrumented, docs updated
Risks: Stripe integration might take longer than estimated (2d → 4d)
```

**Why It Matters:** Sprint planning aligns the team on what's shipping, by when, and why. It creates focus, prevents thrash, and makes blockers visible early.

**Common Mistake:** Over-committing. Teams consistently overestimate capacity—plan for 70% of theoretical hours to account for bugs, meetings, and context-switching.

---

### 25. Launch Checklist

**Category:** Product  
**Key Sections:** Pre-launch (product, marketing, support), Launch day (announce, monitor), Post-launch (iterate, measure)

**Example Content:**
```
Pre-launch:
- [ ] QA passed, no P0 bugs
- [ ] Pricing page live, checkout flow tested
- [ ] Launch blog post drafted (SEO optimized)
- [ ] Support docs updated, team trained on FAQs
Launch day:
- [ ] Announce: Twitter, LinkedIn, email list, Product Hunt
- [ ] Monitor: Error logs, support tickets, social mentions
Post-launch (Week 1):
- [ ] Measure: Signups, activation rate, feedback themes
- [ ] Iterate: Fix top 3 bugs, ship quick wins
```

**Why It Matters:** Launches fail when you forget the basics (docs, monitoring, support). A checklist ensures nothing slips through the cracks.

**Common Mistake:** Treating launch as the finish line. Launch is the *start*—the real work is iteration based on user feedback.

---

## 📈 SALES & MARKETING (5 Templates)

### 26. Cold Email Template (5 Variants)

**Category:** Sales/Marketing  
**Key Sections:** (A) Problem-first, (B) Insight-first, (C) Mutual connection, (D) Quick question, (E) Case study

**Variant A: Problem-First**
```
Subject: Forecasting cash flow for [Company]?

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] raised a seed round last month—congrats! Most founders I work with struggle with one thing after fundraising: knowing when they'll run out of cash.

We built [Product] to solve this. It gives you runway visibility in 5 minutes (vs. 5 spreadsheets).

Worth a 15-min demo? [calendar link]

[Your Name]
```

**Variant B: Insight-First**
```
Subject: [Insight about their business]

Hi [Name],

I was reading your blog post on [topic]—loved the point about [specific insight].

One thing I've noticed with [their industry] companies: they often [problem]. We help [solve it] by [solution].

Would love to share how [Company X] used us to [result]. 15 minutes?

[Your Name]
```

**Variant C: Mutual Connection**
```
Subject: [Mutual contact] suggested I reach out

Hi [Name],

[Mutual contact] mentioned you're tackling [problem] at [Company]. We just helped [similar company] [result]—thought it might be relevant.

Quick intro: [One-sentence pitch]

Worth a chat? [calendar link]

[Your Name]
```

**Variant D: Quick Question**
```
Subject: Quick question about [their challenge]

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How are you currently [task related to your product]?

We help [type of company] [solve problem] without [common pain point]. Curious if it's on your radar.

If so, happy to show you how [Company X] saved [metric].

[Your Name]
```

**Variant E: Case Study**
```
Subject: How [Similar Company] achieved [Metric]

Hi [Name],

[Similar Company] was struggling with [problem]—sound familiar?

They used [Product] to [solution], and within [timeframe]:
- [Result 1]
- [Result 2]
- [Result 3]

I think [Your Company] could see similar results. Worth exploring?

[Your Name]
```

**Why It Matters:** Cold email is the highest-leverage growth channel for B2B startups. Personalization + value = replies. Generic blasts = spam folder.

**Common Mistake:** Pitching features instead of outcomes. Nobody cares about your product—they care about their problem. Lead with pain, not your solution.

---

### 27. Sales Pipeline Tracker

**Category:** Sales/Marketing  
**Key Sections:** Lead name/company, Source, Stage (cold/qualified/demo/proposal/closed), Value, Next step, Last contact

**Example Content:**
```
Acme Corp | Inbound (content) | Demo scheduled | $12K ARR | Next: Demo Feb 10 | Last: Feb 3 (sent case study)
Beta Inc | Outbound (cold email) | Qualified | $8K ARR | Next: Intro call Feb 8 | Last: Feb 5 (replied yes)
Gamma LLC | Referral (Jane) | Proposal sent | $15K ARR | Next: Follow up Feb 12 | Last: Feb 6 (sent proposal)
```

**Why It Matters:** A sales pipeline turns chaos into a system. It shows where deals are stuck, forecasts revenue, and helps you focus on high-intent prospects.

**Common Mistake:** Not defining clear stages or letting deals rot in the pipeline. Review weekly, ruthlessly disqualify dead leads, and focus on movers.

---

### 28. Content Calendar

**Category:** Sales/Marketing  
**Key Sections:** Publish date, Content type, Topic/title, Target keyword, Distribution channels, Owner, Status

**Example Content:**
```
Feb 10 | Blog post | "How to calculate SaaS burn rate (with template)" | "burn rate calculator" | LinkedIn, Twitter, newsletter | Sarah | Draft
Feb 15 | Twitter thread | "5 cap table mistakes that cost founders millions" | N/A | Twitter, repurpose to LinkedIn | Mike | Scheduled
Feb 20 | Video | "Walkthrough: Building a financial model in 10 minutes" | "financial model template" | YouTube, embed in blog | Sarah | Scripting
```

**Why It Matters:** Consistent content builds authority, SEO, and inbound pipeline. A calendar keeps you accountable and ensures you're covering topics strategically (not randomly).

**Common Mistake:** Publishing sporadically or chasing trends. Content compounds—consistency + keyword strategy beats one-off viral posts.

---

### 29. Press Kit

**Category:** Sales/Marketing  
**Key Sections:** Company overview, Founder bios, Product description, Key metrics, Press coverage, Media assets (logos, screenshots), Contact

**Example Content:**
```
Company: [Name] makes financial planning accessible to early-stage founders.
Founded: 2025 | Team: 5 | HQ: Remote
Traction: $50K MRR, 600 customers, 25% MoM growth
Coverage: Featured in TechCrunch, SaaStr, Lenny's Newsletter
Assets: [Link to logo pack, screenshots, founder headshots]
Contact: press@company.com
```

**Why It Matters:** Journalists work fast. A press kit gives them everything they need to write about you in one place. Make it dead simple.

**Common Mistake:** Hiding your press kit or requiring email signup to access it. Make it public, easy to find, and download-friendly.

---

### 30. Partnership Proposal Template

**Category:** Sales/Marketing  
**Key Sections:** Why this partnership, What we're proposing, What's in it for you, Success metrics, Next steps

**Example Content:**
```
Why: [Your Company] and [Their Company] both serve early-stage founders—your strength is [X], ours is [Y].

Proposal: Co-branded content series ("Founder Finance 101") + cross-promotion to both audiences.

What you get:
- Access to our 5K+ newsletter subscribers (95% startup founders)
- Co-marketing (we promote you in 3 pieces of content)
- Shared leads (we'll split inbound from the series)

Success: 500+ signups combined, 50+ qualified leads each, content indexed for SEO.

Next: 30-min call to align on content topics and timeline?
```

**Why It Matters:** Partnerships are force multipliers for distribution. A good proposal is clear on mutual benefit and easy to say yes to.

**Common Mistake:** Asking for more than you give. Partnerships work when both sides win—lead with value, not "please promote us."

---
