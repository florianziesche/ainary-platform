## 🚫 Common Mistakes (Top 20)

Based on analysis of 82+ pitch deck reviews and feedback from VCs.

### **1. Too Wordy (74/82 decks make this mistake)**
- **Problem:** Walls of text. Your pitch deck is not a novel.
- **Fix:** One idea per slide. Use visuals. If you need more than 3 bullets, it's too much.

### **2. No Clear Problem Statement**
- **Problem:** Investors can't understand what pain you're solving
- **Fix:** Make the problem visceral and relatable. Use real stories or data.

### **3. Burying the Traction Slide**
- **Problem:** Hiding your progress at slide 15
- **Fix:** If you have traction, put it in the first 3-5 slides

### **4. Unrealistic Market Size**
- **Problem:** "$10 trillion TAM" with no path to capture it
- **Fix:** Show TAM → SAM → SOM. Be honest about what you can realistically capture.

### **5. No Clear Differentiation**
- **Problem:** "We're like Uber but for X" without explaining why you'll win
- **Fix:** Show your unfair advantage. Why can't competitors copy you in 6 months?

### **6. Weak Team Slide**
- **Problem:** Listing job titles without showing relevant expertise
- **Fix:** Highlight domain expertise, previous exits, complementary skills

### **7. Missing Financial Projections**
- **Problem:** No revenue model or unrealistic hockey stick
- **Fix:** Show unit economics. Be realistic but ambitious.

### **8. Too Technical / Jargon-Heavy**
- **Problem:** "We leverage AI/ML to synergize blockchain-enabled solutions"
- **Fix:** Explain it like you're talking to your smart friend who's not in tech

### **9. Ignoring Competition**
- **Problem:** "We have no competitors" (red flag!)
- **Fix:** Show competitive landscape honestly. Explain why you'll win.

### **10. No Clear Ask**
- **Problem:** Ending without stating how much you're raising and why
- **Fix:** "We're raising $X for Y months runway to achieve Z milestones"

### **11. Inconsistent Design**
- **Problem:** Mix of fonts, colors, styles - looks unprofessional
- **Fix:** Use a template. Keep branding consistent. Clean > flashy.

### **12. Forgetting Contact Info**
- **Problem:** Investor wants to follow up... but can't find your email
- **Fix:** Put contact info on the last slide (and in deck metadata)

### **13. Too Many Slides**
- **Problem:** 40-slide deck that loses investor attention
- **Fix:** 10-20 slides max. Have appendix for detailed info.

### **14. No Demo or Product Screenshots**
- **Problem:** Describing your product without showing it
- **Fix:** Include actual product screenshots, demo video, or prototype

### **15. Unclear Business Model**
- **Problem:** "We'll figure out monetization later"
- **Fix:** Show at least 2-3 revenue stream ideas with assumptions

### **16. Poor Storytelling Flow**
- **Problem:** Jumping randomly between topics
- **Fix:** Follow a logical narrative: Problem → Solution → Market → Why Us → Ask

### **17. Not Addressing Risks**
- **Problem:** Pretending there are no challenges
- **Fix:** Acknowledge 1-2 key risks and show mitigation plan

### **18. Outdated Data**
- **Problem:** Using traction metrics from 6 months ago
- **Fix:** Update your deck monthly with latest numbers

### **19. Weak Opening Slide**
- **Problem:** Generic "About Us" that doesn't hook attention
- **Fix:** Use a bold one-liner or compelling problem stat

### **20. Sending PDF Instead of Using Analytics Tools**
- **Problem:** No idea if investors read your deck or which slides they spent time on
- **Fix:** Use DocSend, Pitch, or similar tools to track engagement
