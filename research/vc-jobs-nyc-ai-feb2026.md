## 📧 Outreach Template (No Posting)

**Subject:** AI Operator → VC Transition — [Fund Name]

Hi [Partner Name],

I'm Florian Ziesche, former CEO of a Computer Vision SaaS (raised €5.5M) and currently building AI systems for manufacturing and legal verticals.

**Why I'm reaching out:** I'm transitioning into VC and [Fund Name]'s thesis on [specific thesis point] resonates deeply with what I've learned as an operator.

**What I bring:**
- Technical depth: Multi-agent RAG, <0.2% hallucination rates, production AI systems
- Operator credibility: CEO for 5 years, fundraised €5.5M, scaled team
- European bridge: Native German, Munich ecosystem, can source EU founders

**Ask:** 15 minutes to discuss how my background could add value to [Fund Name]'s investment process — especially in evaluating technical AI founders.

Happy to share a short writeup on [relevant topic to their thesis].

Best,
Florian
