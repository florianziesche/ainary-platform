# Emerging Manager VC Fund Pitches & LP Strategies: 2025–2026

## 1. Top 5 Things LPs Look for in Emerging Manager Fund I Pitches

Based on insights from Cendana Capital (Michael Kim), Sapphire Partners (Beezer Clarkson), Allocate (Samir Kaji), Carta, Darien Group, and institutional LP research:

### 1. Differentiated Investment Thesis with Structural Edge
LPs ask one question first: **"Why does this fund need to exist?"** Michael Kim at Cendana looks for what he calls **"structural differentiation"** — not a flavor-of-the-month idea, but a crisp market gap supported by the GP's earned edge. A focused, believable niche (e.g., vertical SaaS at pre-seed, or AI tooling for logistics) beats a sprawling generalist claim every time. Darien Group emphasizes that Fund I pitchbooks must accomplish **category education + ownership of the angle** — convince the LP this slice of the market deserves allocation, then prove you are the sharpest expression of it.

> *"LPs reviewing emerging managers are asking: 'Do I believe this corner of the market deserves attention? And if so, is this the right team to explore it?'"* — Darien Group

### 2. Attribution-Based Proxy Track Record
With no fund-level history, LPs demand **deal-by-deal attribution proof**. Beezer Clarkson at Sapphire Partners pushes managers to show sourcing role, ownership of the investment decision, and realized outcomes — not anecdotes. GPs must present a mini-track record from angel deals, scout allocations, or prior-firm investments with clear evidence of who made the call. As Clarkson puts it: **"Attribution isn't a story; it's a spreadsheet."** According to PitchBook's 2024 Venture Monitor, median IRRs for emerging funds vary by more than 25 percentage points between top- and bottom-quartile managers.

### 3. Disciplined Portfolio Construction & Fund Math
LPs get deeply quantitative here. They expect **fund math discipline** — target ownership, check sizes, reserves, and exit assumptions that add up. Michael Kim's **"60× rule"** is now standard LP shorthand: a $100M fund targeting 5% ownership must reach ~$6B in cumulative exit value to hit 3× returns. Samir Kaji consistently advises first-time managers to **"stay small, stay authentic"** — a $40M focused seed fund may be more credible than a $150M generalist one. Flawed portfolio construction (unrealistic assumptions, math that doesn't align with investment goals) is one of the biggest red flags.

> *Key metrics LPs stress-test: target ownership %, check size-to-fund ratio, reserve strategy, deployment pace, and modeled DPI paths by year.*

### 4. DPI Awareness & Path to Liquidity
**The DPI era is here.** With exits stalled, LPs prioritize distributions over paper gains. Hamilton Lane and other allocators emphasize that DPI is now a top metric, not just TVPI. Cambridge Associates data shows only top-quartile funds consistently sustain high DPI across vintages. Emerging managers who articulate secondary or early-exit strategies — and model how capital returns by **year 7, not year 15** — score significantly higher. Venture secondaries' addressable market is now estimated at $80B+. LPs don't expect miracles, but they expect realistic awareness.

> *"LPs now ask: how can I get distributions earlier? Managers who speak distribution, not just markup, will gain trust first."*

### 5. Team Cohesion, GP Alignment & Skin in the Game
LPs evaluate team **"decision chemistry"** (Beezer Clarkson's term) as much as credentials. They want complementary skills — sourcing reach, portfolio discipline, and operator DNA. Key alignment signals:
- **GP commitment:** Typical is ~3%, but institutional benchmarks suggest 10–13% creates optimal alignment. Under-committing signals weak conviction.
- **Founder pull:** LPs measure inbound-to-outbound ratio and back-channel with portfolio founders to validate trust. Samir Kaji notes the difference between "sourcing" and "winning" — founder references often weigh more heavily than peer references.
- **Intellectual honesty & learning velocity:** LPs look for post-mortems, a "thesis change log," and evidence of fast iteration. Michael Kim at Cendana studies *how managers adapt*, not just what they believe on day one.

## 4. Most Common Mistakes First-Time GPs Make

### Data-Backed Findings

#### From LP Blueprint Analysis (n=20 emerging manager VC fundraises, 2023–2024):

**The #1 finding:** 70% of successful funds had a **named anchor LP** before they formally launched. **0% of failed funds had an anchor.**

| Factor | Successful Funds | Failed Funds |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Had anchor LP pre-launch | **70%** | **0%** |
| GP pedigree (3+ yrs at established VC) | **80%** | 20% |
| Used placement agents | **0%** | 20% |
| Active public content/speaking | 60% | 40% |

**Source:** [LP Blueprint — Fundraising Execution Gap](https://www.lpblueprint.com/blog/the-fundraising-execution-gap-what-separated-success-from-failure-in-2023-2024)

#### From VC Lab (600+ fund launches):

1. **Engaging expensive legal counsel before securing commitments** — the most common mistake. Successful managers average six-month formation timelines; failed ones burn capital prematurely on infrastructure before having LP momentum.
2. **Setting up fund infrastructure before fundraising** — Entities, legal docs, admin, bank accounts, and regulatory compliance can (and should) wait until you have fundraising momentum. Building all this first delays first close by months and can kill a fund.
3. **Underestimating the grind** — Assuming early soft commitments mean the raise will be easy. It almost always takes 6–12 months to first close, even with anchor LPs.

#### From Kauffman Foundation (20+ years, ~100 VC fund investments):

- **Oversized funds relative to strategy** — GPs raise too much capital, diluting ownership and stranding performance. Fund size should be determined by what you can credibly win, not how much you think you should raise.
- **Inadequate GP commitment** — Most GPs contribute only ~1% personal capital. Kauffman suggests closer to 5% for true alignment.
- **Misaligned fee structures** — Many first-time managers want to innovate on fees but revert to 2/20 to ease fundraising, without considering whether it's optimal for their fund size.
- **Over-reliance on TVPI / paper returns** — Especially common with smaller emerging funds. LPs need to see a credible path to DPI (distributions), not just markups.

#### Additional Common Mistakes (aggregated from VC Factory, GoingVC, Proskauer 2025):

5. **Treating all LPs as one category** — Family offices, endowments, fund-of-funds, and HNWIs all have radically different needs, timelines, and decision processes. Tailoring your pitch matters.
6. **Flawed portfolio construction** — Using unrealistic assumptions in return projections. LPs will stress-test every number.
7. **No founder references / weak back-channel** — LPs back-channel extensively with portfolio founders. If your founders can't speak to specific value you've added, it's a red flag.
8. **Cold outreach as primary LP strategy** — The data shows 0% success from managers trying to build institutional relationships from scratch during the fundraise itself. Relationships must precede the raise by months or years.
9. **Copying Fund VII deck templates** — Fund I has the opposite job of a later-fund deck. There's no franchise arc. LPs need: clear category, understandable angle, something memorable. Copying your former employer's materials doesn't work.
10. **Not speaking DPI** — In the current market, speaking only about markups and TVPI instead of distribution strategy is disqualifying for many institutional LPs.

## Key Takeaways for Emerging Managers in 2026

1. **Secure an anchor LP before formal launch** — this is the single highest-signal predictor of success
2. **Right-size your fund** — smaller, focused funds ($20M–$60M at seed) are more credible than oversized generalist vehicles
3. **Lead with thesis, not track record** — Fund I decks should educate LPs on the category and own the angle
4. **Speak DPI** — model realistic distribution timelines and secondary/liquidity strategies
5. **Build LP relationships 12–24 months before you need them** — the raise starts long before the formal fundraise
6. **Document your intellectual honesty** — post-mortems, thesis evolution, learning velocity are the new mindset factors
7. **Don't overspend on infrastructure pre-raise** — legal and admin costs can wait until you have momentum
8. **Build content/brand as a long-term investment** — newsletters, reports, podcasts compound over years but don't substitute for relationships
