## Pattern Analysis: Was funktioniert

### Die 5 Viral Post Types (Forbes 2025 Research)

1. **"Here's my process" Post** — Step-by-step how you do something
   - Hook: Bold outcome + "Here's exactly how"
   - Body: Numbered steps with specifics
   - Why: People save actionable content

2. **Contrarian Take** — Challenge common belief
   - Hook: "Unpopular opinion:" or "Everyone says X. They're wrong."
   - Body: Evidence why the opposite is true
   - Why: Triggers debate = comments = reach

3. **Personal Story → Business Lesson**
   - Hook: Emotional/vulnerable opening ("I got fired." "I was broke.")
   - Body: What happened, what you learned
   - Why: Relatability + vulnerability = trust

4. **Data/Research Breakdown**
   - Hook: Surprising stat ("I analyzed 10K posts...")
   - Body: Findings with implications
   - Why: Perceived credibility + shareability

5. **Framework/Mental Model**
   - Hook: "The X framework changed everything"
   - Body: Visual or structured explanation
   - Why: People share tools they can use

### Hook Patterns (aus 100K+ Post Analyse)

**Top Performing Hook Formulas:**
1. "I [did X]. Here's what I learned:" — Personal + Promise
2. "Stop [common mistake]. Do [this] instead." — Command + Alternative
3. "[Bold claim]. Let me explain." — Tension + Curiosity
4. "Everyone is talking about [X]. Nobody is talking about [Y]." — Reframe
5. "[Number] [things] I wish I knew about [topic]" — Listicle + Regret
6. "I spent [time] studying [topic]. Here's the summary:" — Effort = Value
7. "The biggest mistake I see [audience] make:" — Expertise + Pain
8. "Unpopular opinion: [contrarian take]" — Debate trigger
9. "[Question]? The answer surprised me." — Curiosity gap
10. "In [year], I [result]. In [year], I [worse result]. Here's why:" — Arc

### Formatting Rules

**LinkedIn:**
- Erste 2 Zeilen = alles (vor "See More")
- Kurze Absätze (1-2 Sätze)
- Leerzeile zwischen jedem Gedanken
- 150-300 Wörter optimal
- KEIN Hashtag-Spam (max 3, am Ende)
- Kein Link im Post (kills reach) — Link in Comments
- CTA als Frage am Ende (treibt Comments)

**Twitter/X:**
- Thread Hook = Tweet 1 muss standalone funktionieren
- 8-12 Tweets optimal
- Jeder Tweet = eigener Gedanke
- Last Tweet = CTA (Follow, Retweet, Newsletter)
- Quote-Tweet eigene Threads nach 24h

**Substack:**
- 1500-2500 Wörter ideal
- Strong visual/graphic in first fold
- Personal angle > pure analysis
- Consistency > quality (weekly > perfect monthly)

### Posting Frequency (Top Performers)

| Plattform | Frequency | Best Time (US ET) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| LinkedIn | 4-5x/Woche | 8-10 AM Tu-Th |
| Twitter | 3-5x/Tag | 8 AM, 12 PM, 5 PM |
| Substack | 1x/Woche | Tuesday AM |
