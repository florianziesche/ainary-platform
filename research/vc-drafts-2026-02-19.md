## 1. FutureSight — Investment Team Application

**TO:** careers@futuresight.vc *(verify correct email before sending)*  
**SUBJECT:** Application: Investment Team — Ex-CEO with AI/LLM Operating Experience

**BODY:**

I'm applying to join FutureSight's investment team. I bring founder operating experience that translates directly to portfolio value.

**Background:**
- Built and exited 36ZERO Vision (€5M raised, 15-person team, enterprise CV/AI for BMW, Siemens, Bosch)
- Currently building AgentTrust — trust infrastructure for agentic AI systems
- VC Lab Fellow (Decile Group) with active dealflow in AI tooling and infrastructure

**What I bring:**
- Technical depth in LLMs, RAG, agentic systems — can evaluate architecture, not just pitch decks
- Enterprise sales cycle understanding — closed 6-figure deals with German automotive/industrial
- Pattern recognition across nascent markets — recent deep dive on YC RFS identified 3 strong AI-native agency theses
- Founder empathy — I've raised capital, hired technical teams, and navigated pivots

I can source technical founders, evaluate deep tech credibly, and add operational value to portfolio companies from day one.

Available for a conversation this week or next.

Best,

## 2. Betaworks — Investment Associate Cold Outreach

**TO:** jobs@betaworks.com *(or via VC Platform: https://www.vcplatform.com/jobs)*  
**SUBJECT:** Investment Associate — Operator Background in AI/Product

**BODY:**

I'm reaching out about the Investment Associate role at Betaworks. Your product-first approach to seed investing aligns with how I've built companies.

**Relevant background:**
- Ex-CEO 36ZERO Vision — raised €5M, built enterprise Computer Vision/LLM platform for BMW, Siemens, Bosch
- Operator in AI stack: deployed RAG systems, fine-tuned models, navigated LLM governance for regulated industries
- VC Lab Fellow (Decile) — currently sourcing AI-native agency and dev tool opportunities

**Why Betaworks:**
- Your studio + fund model values builders — I've been both founder and operator
- Portfolio focus (HuggingFace, dev tools) matches my technical background
- NYC-based, early-stage, product-obsessed — exactly where I want to invest long-term

**What I'd bring:**
- Technical due diligence on AI/ML companies (architecture, not just buzzwords)
- Sourcing through founder networks (YC, European AI ecosystem)
- Portfolio support on enterprise go-to-market and technical hiring

I can evaluate both the technology and the business model — happy to discuss how that translates to Betaworks' investment approach.

## 3. Decile Capital — Resident Follow-Up

**TO:** *(insert contact name/email from previous conversation)*  
**SUBJECT:** Following Up — Resident Application + Recent Work

**BODY:**

Following up on our earlier conversation about the Resident role. I've continued building my investment practice and wanted to share a recent output that reflects how I approach market research.

**Update:**
- Completed YC RFS Spring 2026 analysis — identified 3 high-conviction AI theses (AI-native agencies, LLM training infrastructure, AI for government)
- Active pipeline: sourced 5 early-stage AI companies through VC Lab network, conducting technical diligence on 2
- AgentTrust development — deployed trust scoring framework, validated with 14 research briefs at $0.005/check

**Why I'm excited about Decile:**
- Resident model aligns with how I want to learn — hands-on, collaborative, long-term apprenticeship
- Your focus on underestimated founders matches my sourcing network (European AI founders entering US market)
- Operator-to-investor transition done right — I want to build the craft, not just add "VC" to LinkedIn

Attached my updated materials. Happy to walk through recent deal analysis or discuss how I'd contribute to portfolio support.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Best,  
Florian
