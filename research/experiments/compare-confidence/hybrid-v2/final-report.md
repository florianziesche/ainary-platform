## Research Brief

1) **Primary Research Question (+ why now):**
   - How can trust in AI agents be effectively calibrated to ensure optimal human-AI collaboration? This question is critical now due to the increasing integration of AI systems in decision-making processes across various industries, necessitating a reliable framework for trust calibration to prevent over-reliance or under-utilization of AI capabilities.

2) **Decision Context (who decides; consequence if wrong):**
   - The decision to implement trust calibration strategies will be made by the Founder. Incorrect calibration could lead to either over-trust, resulting in potential misuse or failure of AI systems, or under-trust, leading to underutilization and missed opportunities for efficiency and innovation.

3) **Sub-Questions (5–12; non-overlapping):**
   - What are the current models and frameworks for trust calibration in AI systems?
   - How does transparency in AI systems affect trust calibration?
   - What role does system performance play in trust calibration?
   - How can adaptive trust calibration methods be implemented effectively?
   - What are the key challenges in achieving appropriate trust calibration?
   - How do human factors influence trust calibration in AI systems?
   - What are the implications of improper trust calibration on AI system deployment?
   - How can trust calibration be measured and validated?
   - What are the best practices for communicating trustworthiness in AI systems?
   - How do different industries approach trust calibration for AI agents?

4) **Evidence Criteria (inclusion/exclusion):**
   - Include peer-reviewed papers, official standards, and arXiv preprints with caveats.
   - Exclude LLM-generated content, blog posts without data, and unverifiable claims.

5) **Key Terms & Definitions:**
   - Trust Calibration: The process of adjusting the level of trust in AI systems to match their actual capabilities and reliability.
   - Over-Trust: Excessive reliance on AI systems beyond their proven capabilities.
   - Under-Trust: Insufficient reliance on AI systems, leading to underutilization.

6) **Intended Audience:**
   - Founder

7) **Planned Methods & Sources:**
   - Systematic review of existing literature, meta-analysis of empirical studies, and expert synthesis from peer-reviewed sources and arXiv preprints.

8) **Stopping Criteria (confidence target; acceptable uncertainty; what changes conclusion):**
   - Achieve a high confidence level in the identified trust calibration strategies with acceptable uncertainty limited to emerging technologies. New empirical evidence or significant changes in AI capabilities could alter conclusions.
