# RESEARCH BRIEF

1) **Primary Research Question (+ why now)**
   - How can trust calibration for AI agents be effectively achieved to ensure reliable human-AI collaboration? This question is critical now due to the increasing integration of AI systems in decision-making processes across various industries, necessitating a clear understanding of trust dynamics to prevent over-reliance or under-utilization of AI capabilities.

2) **Decision Context (who decides; consequence if wrong)**
   - The decision to be informed is likely made by the Founder or executive team responsible for AI strategy. Incorrect trust calibration could lead to significant operational risks, including poor decision-making, reduced efficiency, and potential safety hazards.

3) **Sub-Questions (5–12; non-overlapping)**
   - What are the current models and frameworks for trust calibration in AI systems?
   - How does transparency in AI systems affect trust calibration?
   - What empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of adaptive trust calibration methods?
   - How do different AI architectures impact trust calibration?
   - What are the key challenges in achieving appropriate trust calibration?
   - How can trust calibration be measured and validated?
   - What role does user feedback play in trust calibration?
   - How do cultural and contextual factors influence trust calibration?
   - What are the implications of improper trust calibration on AI deployment?
   - How can trust calibration be integrated into AI system design processes?

4) **Evidence Criteria (inclusion/exclusion)**
   - Include peer-reviewed papers, official standards, and empirical studies. Exclude LLM-generated content, unverifiable claims, and informal sources.

5) **Key Terms & Definitions**
   - Trust Calibration: The process of adjusting the level of trust in AI systems to match their actual capabilities and reliability.
   - AI Agent: A software entity that performs tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
   - Transparency: The degree to which an AI system's processes and decision-making are understandable to users.

6) **Intended Audience**
   - Founder and executive team responsible for AI strategy and implementation.

7) **Planned Methods & Sources**
   - Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, analysis of empirical studies, and evaluation of existing trust calibration models.

8) **Stopping Criteria (confidence target; acceptable uncertainty; what changes conclusion)**
   - Achieve a high confidence level in identifying effective trust calibration methods. Acceptable uncertainty includes minor variations in empirical results. New significant empirical evidence or theoretical models could change conclusions.
