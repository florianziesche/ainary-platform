   - What role does user feedback play in trust calibration?
   - How can trust calibration be integrated into existing research pipelines?
   - What are the best practices for maintaining trust calibration over time?

4) **Evidence Criteria (inclusion/exclusion)**
   - Inclusion: Peer-reviewed papers, official standards (NIST/ISO/EU), arXiv preprints, lab tech reports.
   - Exclusion: LLM-generated content, unverifiable sources, informal documents.

5) **Key Terms & Definitions**
   - Trust Calibration: The process of adjusting the level of trust in AI agents to align with their actual performance and reliability.
   - AI Agent: A software entity that performs tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
   - Research Pipeline: A structured sequence of processes and tools used in conducting research.

6) **Intended Audience**
   - Researchers and decision-makers involved in configuring and optimizing research pipelines.

7) **Planned Methods & Sources**
   - Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and industry standards.
