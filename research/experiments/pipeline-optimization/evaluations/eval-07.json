  "evaluator_notes": "The report aligns well with the decision context and provides actionable recommendations. Evidence is well-cited, but the report lacks explicit discussion of uncertainty and does not identify or resolve contradictions. The risks and mitigations are somewhat generic, lacking depth in realism and mitigation strategies. Novel insights are present but limited to new connections rather than groundbreaking findings."
