  "evaluator_notes": "The report is well-aligned with the decision context and provides a comprehensive structure with all required sections. Citations are present and verifiable, leading to a high claim verification rate. However, while contradictions in the literature are identified, the report does not effectively resolve them, which affects the contradictions handled score. The report provides actionable recommendations, but the realism of failure modes and risk mitigation strategies could be improved. Novel insights are present, particularly in connecting known ideas, but they are not groundbreaking."
