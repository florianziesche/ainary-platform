  "evaluator_notes": "The report aligns well with the primary research question and is well-structured, covering all required sections. However, evidence discipline is lacking as only one source is explicitly cited, leading to a low claim verification rate. Uncertainty integrity is weak, with limited discussion on what could change the conclusions. The report identifies some risks but lacks depth in failure modes realism and risk mitigation strategies. Novel insights are present in connecting known ideas, but no groundbreaking findings are introduced. Contradictions are not explicitly identified or resolved."
