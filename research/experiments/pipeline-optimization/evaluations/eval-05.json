  "evaluator_notes": "The report aligns well with the primary research question and is well-structured, covering all required sections. However, evidence discipline is lacking as not all claims are backed by verifiable sources, and the claim verification rate is moderate. Uncertainty is mentioned but not deeply explored, and contradictions are not explicitly identified or resolved. The report provides some actionable recommendations but lacks depth in risk mitigation and failure modes realism. Novel insights are limited, mostly reiterating known concepts with minor new framing."
