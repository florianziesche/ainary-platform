  "evaluator_notes": "The report aligns well with the primary research question and is well-structured, covering all required sections. However, evidence discipline is lacking as only two sources are cited, and not all claims are backed by verifiable sources. Uncertainty integrity is moderate; while confidence levels are mentioned, the report lacks depth in discussing what could change the conclusions. Contradictions are not explicitly identified or resolved. Actionability is present but could be more detailed in terms of specific next steps. Failure modes are mentioned but not deeply explored, and risk mitigation strategies are somewhat generic. The report offers mostly known insights with limited novel connections."
