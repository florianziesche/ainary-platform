  "evaluator_notes": "The report aligns well with the primary research question and includes all required sections, but lacks depth in evidence discipline as only two sources are cited. Uncertainty is mentioned but not deeply explored, and contradictions are not explicitly identified or resolved. Actionability is present but could be more detailed. The report provides some new connections between known ideas but lacks groundbreaking insights."
