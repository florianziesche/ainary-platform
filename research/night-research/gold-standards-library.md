## 1. Research Report

### International Standards / Norms

| Standard | Scope | URL |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **PRISMA 2020** | Systematic reviews & meta-analyses — 27-item checklist + flow diagram | https://www.prisma-statement.org |
| **EQUATOR Network** | Umbrella for all research reporting guidelines (CONSORT, STROBE, etc.) | https://www.equator-network.org |
| **ISO 690:2021** | Bibliographic references and citations | https://www.iso.org/standard/72642.html |
| **ISO 214** | Rules for abstracts | https://www.iso.org/standard/4084.html |
| **ISO 2145** | Numbering of divisions/subdivisions in written documents | — |
| **APA 7th Edition** | Social science research formatting and citation | https://apastyle.apa.org |
| **RAND Standards** | High-quality policy research and analysis | https://www.rand.org/pubs/corporate_pubs/CPA1927-1.html |

### Best-in-Class Examples

1. **McKinsey Global Institute Reports** — Gold standard for consulting-style research. Pyramid Principle structure: answer first, then evidence. https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/overview
2. **RAND Corporation Research Reports** — Policy research with rigorous methodology sections, clear limitations, and actionable recommendations. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports.html
3. **a16z / Andreessen Horowitz Research** — Modern tech-investment research: data-rich, visual, opinionated theses. https://a16z.com/research/
4. **CB Insights Research** — Best-in-class market maps, data visualization, and accessible formatting for business audiences. https://www.cbinsights.com/research/
5. **Brookings Institution** — Academic rigor with policy accessibility. https://www.brookings.edu/research/

### Common Structure / Pattern

All top research reports share:
- **Executive Summary** (1 page max) — key finding + "so what"
- **Context / Background** — why this matters now
- **Methodology** — how the research was conducted (transparency)
- **Findings** — organized by theme, with data visualizations
- **Analysis / Implications** — second-order effects, what it means
- **Recommendations** — specific, actionable
- **Appendices** — detailed data, methodology notes
- **Pyramid Principle (McKinsey):** Lead with the conclusion, then support with grouped arguments, then detail

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Answer first.** Open with your conclusion in the first paragraph. Busy readers may never reach page 3.
2. **MECE your sections.** Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive — no overlaps, no gaps in your argument structure.
3. **Every claim has a source.** Link or footnote every data point. Unsourced claims destroy credibility.
4. **Visualize, don't describe.** If a finding can be a chart, make it a chart. Data tables for precision; charts for patterns.
5. **"So what?" on every page.** Every section must answer why the reader should care. If you can't state the implication, cut it.

## 2. LinkedIn Post

### International Standards / Norms

No formal ISO standard exists for social media posts. The closest norms:
- **LinkedIn's own algorithm guidance** (2024): prioritizes "knowledge and advice" posts, dwell time, meaningful comments
- **Creator mode best practices** from LinkedIn's creator hub
- Industry consensus: 150–300 words for quick engagement; 1,000+ words for authority-building

### Best-in-Class Examples (VC/AI Thought Leaders)

1. **Justin Welsh** — Solopreneur/creator; master of hook + listicle + CTA format. 900K+ followers. https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinwelsh/ | Framework: https://www.justinwelsh.me/newsletter/the-anatomy-of-a-viral-linkedin-post
2. **Tomasz Tunguz** — VC at Theory Ventures; data-driven posts with charts, one insight per post. https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasztunguz/ | Blog: https://tomtunguz.com
3. **Sarah Guo** — GP at Conviction; AI-native VC. Opinionated takes on AI adoption. https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahguo/
4. **Chamath Palihapitiya** — Social Capital; long-form contrarian takes, provocative first lines. https://www.linkedin.com/in/chamath/
5. **Lenny Rachitsky** — Product/growth; shares newsletter excerpts + asks questions. https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/
6. **Packy McCormick** — Not Boring; narrative-driven, optimistic tech takes. https://www.linkedin.com/in/packymccormick/
7. **Sahil Bloom** — Framework-oriented posts; visual formatting. https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahaborig/
8. **Elad Gil** — Quiet authority; short, dense, signal-rich. https://www.linkedin.com/in/eladgil/
9. **Li Jin** — Atelier Ventures; creator economy + new business models. https://www.linkedin.com/in/lijin/
10. **Reid Hoffman** — Greylock; long-form thought leadership + book excerpts. https://www.linkedin.com/in/reidhoffman/

### Common Structure / Pattern

The **Hook → Body → CTA** framework dominates:

```
[Line 1: Scroll-stopping hook — bold claim, counter-intuitive insight, or curiosity gap]
[Line 2-3: Why you should click "see more" — tease the payoff]

—

[Body: 5-15 short paragraphs, heavy whitespace]
[Lists, numbered steps, or "X lessons from Y"]
[One core insight, not three]

—

[CTA: Question to audience, or "Repost if useful"]
```

**Format rules observed:**
- One sentence per line (mobile-first)
- Heavy line breaks (whitespace = readability)
- Emojis sparingly (1-2 max, for structure not decoration)
- No external links in the main post (kills reach); put links in comments
- Personal stories outperform generic advice 2:1

### 5 Template Rules

1. **First line = 80% of the work.** If they don't stop scrolling, nothing else matters. Use a specific number, bold claim, or unexpected opener.
2. **One idea per post.** The best posts teach ONE thing clearly. Don't dilute.
3. **Write for mobile.** Short sentences. Lots of line breaks. No walls of text.
4. **End with engagement.** Ask a genuine question or invite repost. The algorithm rewards comments > reactions.
5. **No links in the post body.** LinkedIn penalizes outbound links. Put them in the first comment instead.

---

## 3. Substack / Newsletter Article

### International Standards / Norms

No formal standard. However, these frameworks are the de facto norms:
- **Inverted Pyramid** (journalism) — most important info first
- **Essay structure** (narrative nonfiction) — hook, thesis, evidence, synthesis
- **Serialized publishing conventions** — consistent cadence, branded format, subscriber-first voice

### Best-in-Class Examples

1. **Stratechery** (Ben Thompson) — The original paid newsletter. Deep strategic analysis of tech. Framework: one concept per article, proprietary frameworks (Aggregation Theory), clear thesis. Free weekly article + 3 paid Daily Updates. https://stratechery.com
2. **Lenny's Newsletter** (Lenny Rachitsky) — Product/growth. Research-heavy, interview-based, deeply tactical. Format: big question → survey data → expert quotes → actionable framework. 1M+ subscribers. https://www.lennysnewsletter.com
3. **Not Boring** (Packy McCormick) — Startup/tech analysis. Narrative-driven, fun, optimistic. Format: cultural hook → company deep dive → thesis → strategic analysis. 250K+ subscribers. https://www.notboring.co
4. **The Generalist** (Mario Gabriele) — VC/startup deep dives. Long-form (5,000-10,000 words), meticulously researched. Format: company profile → market context → business model → competitive landscape → investment case. https://www.generalist.com
5. **Morning Brew** — B2B/general business. Short, punchy, personality-driven. Scannable format with consistent sections. 4.2M subscribers. https://www.morningbrew.com

### Common Structure / Pattern

```
[Subject Line: Curiosity-driven, specific]

[Opening Hook: 1-3 sentences — personal story, surprising stat, or cultural reference]

[The Big Idea / Thesis: One sentence that frames the whole piece]

[Section 1: Context / Background]
[Section 2: Analysis / Evidence]  
[Section 3: Implications / "So What?"]

[Conclusion: Restate thesis + forward-looking thought]

[CTA: Share, subscribe, or respond]
```

**Key differences between top newsletters:**
- **Stratechery:** Analytical, framework-heavy, no fluff, professional tone
- **Lenny's:** Research-based, tactical, data-driven, peer-to-peer voice
- **Not Boring:** Narrative, cultural, fun, optimistic, investment-focused
- **The Generalist:** Encyclopedic, visual, long-form, investor-oriented

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Hook in first 3 sentences.** The preview text/email subject line determines open rates. Start with your most interesting line, not a preamble.
2. **One thesis per article.** You can have sub-points, but there should be one clear "if you remember nothing else" takeaway.
3. **Use headers for scannability.** Assume 40% of readers skim. Headers + bold key sentences = they still get value.
4. **Write like you talk.** The newsletters that win are conversational, not formal. First person. Short sentences. Personality.
5. **Consistent format builds habit.** Pick a structure (sections, recurring features, sign-off) and keep it every issue. Familiarity = trust = retention.

## 4. Cold Outreach Email

### International Standards / Norms

| Standard | Scope | URL |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **CAN-SPAM Act** (US) | Commercial email requirements: opt-out, physical address, honest headers | https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business |
| **GDPR** (EU) | Requires legitimate interest basis for B2B cold email; strict for B2C | https://gdpr.eu |
| **CASL** (Canada) | Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation | https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/internet/anti.htm |

### Key Statistics (2025-2026 benchmarks)

- Average cold email **open rate:** 27.7% (B2B)
- Average cold email **reply rate:** 1-5% (baseline), 8-12% (well-optimized)
- **Personalized subject lines:** +30-50% open rate increase
- **Follow-ups:** Reply rates improve 50%+ with consistent follow-ups; 48% of reps never send a second message
- **Optimal length:** Under 100 words / ½ paragraph
- **Best timing:** Wednesday 7-11 AM recipient's timezone
- **Best sequence:** 2-email sequence with 1 follow-up generates most responses (6.9% reply rate)

Sources: Snov.io 2026, Belkins 2025, Lemlist, Martal Group

### Best-in-Class Frameworks

1. **Alex Berman's 3C Framework** — Compliment, Case Study, Call to Action. Proven 10-25% response rate. https://alexberman.com | https://x27marketing.com/insights/how-to-write-the-ultimate-cold-email-framework-alxberman-alex-berman/
2. **Instantly's Copywriting Framework** — 400+ replies/month. Hyper-personalized first line + 2-3 sentences max. https://help.instantly.ai/en/articles/6570131-cold-email-copywriting-framework
3. **Lemlist's Subject Line Data** — Analyzed millions of campaigns. 6 proven tactics for >80% open rates. https://www.lemlist.com/blog/cold-email-subject-line
4. **Woodpecker's Follow-up Framework** — Structured sequences with data on optimal timing and frequency. https://woodpecker.co/blog/cold-email-best-practices/
5. **Kyle Coleman (formerly Clari)** — "The 10-30-10" rule: 10 min research, 30 sec to read, 10 sec to respond. https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabortz/

### Common Structure / Pattern

**The ideal cold email (under 100 words):**
```
Subject: [Personal + specific — their name, company, or trigger event]

Hi [First Name],

[1 sentence: Personalized observation about them/their company — proves you did homework]

[1-2 sentences: Your value prop tied to their situation — with a proof point/case study]

[1 sentence: Low-friction CTA — question, not demand]

[Signature]
```

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Subject line = their world, not yours.** Include their name, company, or a recent event. Never "Introduction" or "[Company] + [Your Company]."
2. **Under 100 words, always.** The shorter the email, the higher the reply rate. If it looks long on mobile, it won't be read.
3. **Personalized first line proves you're human.** Reference something specific — a podcast appearance, a LinkedIn post, a company announcement. Never fake it.
4. **One CTA, and make it easy.** "Would a 15-min call this week make sense?" beats "I'd love to schedule a demo and send you our case study and connect on LinkedIn."
5. **Follow up 2-3 times.** Most replies come on follow-up #1 or #2. Space them 3-5 days apart. Add new value in each (different angle, social proof, relevant content).

## 5. VC Cover Letter / Application

### International Standards / Norms

No formal ISO standard. Industry norms come from:
- **Mergers & Inquisitions / Wall Street Oasis** — IB/PE/VC recruiting standards
- **GoingVC** — VC-specific career guidance
- **Leland** — VC recruiting frameworks from actual partners

### Best-in-Class Resources

1. **Leland: "How to Get Into VC" (100+ Interviews)** — Partner at a top firm on what makes candidates stand out. https://www.joinleland.com/library/a/how-to-get-into-venture-capital
2. **GoingVC: 10 Actionable Steps** — Emphasis on relationship-building over cold applications. https://www.goingvc.com/post/10-actionable-steps-to-get-a-job-in-venture-capital
3. **Mergers & Inquisitions: VC Careers** — Comprehensive overview of VC recruiting landscape. https://mergersandinquisitions.com/venture-capital-careers/
4. **Venture Capital Careers: Cover Letter Guide** — Template + tips specific to VC associate roles. https://venturecapitalcareers.com/blog/venture-capital-associate-cover-letter
5. **Leland: VC Recruiting Guide (2026)** — Full process breakdown. https://www.joinleland.com/library/a/a-guide-to-recruiting-for-venture-capital

### What Hiring VCs Actually Want

Based on research across partner interviews and VC hiring managers:

1. **Demonstrated thesis / point of view** — Not "I'm passionate about startups." Show a specific investment thesis or sector view.
2. **Proof of hustle** — Deal flow sourcing, angel investing, startup experience, content/writing about startups
3. **Network / relationships** — VC is a relationship business. Who referred you matters more than your GPA.
4. **Analytical + communication skills** — Can you evaluate a business AND explain it compellingly?
5. **Cultural fit / values alignment** — Do you fit THIS firm's approach, stage focus, and thesis?

### Common Structure / Pattern

```
[Paragraph 1: WHY THIS FIRM — Specific, not generic. Reference a portfolio company, a partner's talk, or the firm's thesis.]

[Paragraph 2: WHAT YOU BRING — Your unique background + how it maps to what they need. Include 1-2 concrete proof points.]

[Paragraph 3: YOUR THESIS / POV — Demonstrate independent thinking. A sector view, a trend you're tracking, a company you'd pitch them.]

[Paragraph 4: THE ASK — Clear, confident close. Express enthusiasm + next step.]
```

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Lead with the firm, not yourself.** "I've followed [Fund]'s thesis on vertical AI since [Partner]'s [talk/post]..." beats "I am excited to apply for..."
2. **Include a mini investment thesis.** VCs want to see how you think. Name a company, sector, or trend you'd want the fund to explore — and why.
3. **Proof > claims.** Don't say "I'm analytical." Say "I evaluated 200+ seed-stage companies at [Accelerator] and led diligence on 3 investments."
4. **One page max.** Anything longer won't be read. Density > length.
5. **Send via warm intro whenever possible.** Cold applications have <5% hit rate. Even a weak warm intro 10x your chances.

---

## 6. Pitch Deck / Presentation

### International Standards / Norms

No ISO standard, but two frameworks dominate the startup ecosystem:

| Framework | Creator | Key Rule | URL |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----|
| **Sequoia Format** | Sequoia Capital | 10-12 slides: Company Purpose → Problem → Solution → Why Now → Market Size → Competition → Product → Business Model → Team → Financials | https://www.uvic.ca/gustavson/_assets/docs/pitch-deck-template-web.pdf |
| **10/20/30 Rule** | Guy Kawasaki | 10 slides, 20 minutes, 30pt minimum font | https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/ |
| **Y Combinator Format** | YC | Minimal: Problem, Solution, Traction, Team, Ask | https://www.ycombinator.com/library/2u-how-to-build-your-seed-round-pitch-deck |
| **Pyramid Principle** | Barbara Minto / McKinsey | Conclusion first, then supporting evidence | https://www.myconsultingoffer.org/case-study-interview-prep/pyramid-principle/ |

### Best-in-Class Examples

1. **Sequoia Capital Pitch Deck Template** — THE global standard for startup pitch decks. 12 slides covering the full story. https://pitchbuilder.io/blogs/news/what-is-the-sequoia-pitch-deck-model | Original PDF: https://www.uvic.ca/gustavson/_assets/docs/pitch-deck-template-web.pdf
2. **Airbnb's Original Pitch Deck** — Often cited as one of the best ever. Clean, simple, story-driven. https://www.slideshare.net/PitchDeckCoach/airbnb-first-pitch-deck-editable
3. **Buffer's Open Pitch Deck** — Transparency pioneer; shared their actual fundraising deck publicly. https://buffer.com/resources/buffer-series-a-deck/
4. **Guy Kawasaki 10/20/30 Framework** — Practical constraints that force clarity. https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/
5. **Slidebean's Pitch Deck Collection** — Database of 100+ real pitch decks from funded startups. https://slidebean.com/pitch-deck-examples

### Common Structure (Sequoia Standard)

```
1. Company Purpose — One sentence that captures the mission
2. Problem — What pain exists? For whom?
3. Solution — How you solve it
4. Why Now — Why is this the right moment?
5. Market Size — TAM / SAM / SOM
6. Competition — Landscape + your differentiation
7. Product — Demo, screenshots, or architecture
8. Business Model — How you make money
9. Team — Why this team wins
10. Traction — Metrics, growth, milestones
11. Financials — Projections + unit economics
12. The Ask — How much, use of funds, timeline
```

### 5 Template Rules

1. **One slide, one idea.** If a slide needs a "let me explain this" intro, it's too complex. Split it.
2. **10 words or fewer per bullet.** The deck supports YOUR pitch — it's not a teleprompter. Less text = more attention on you.
3. **Show traction early.** If you have numbers, don't wait until slide 10. Move your best metrics to slide 3-4.
4. **30pt font minimum.** If you need smaller font, you have too many words. (Guy Kawasaki's rule stands.)
5. **Design for 2 audiences.** The deck must work both in person (minimal text, big visuals) AND as a leave-behind (enough context to stand alone via email). Version both if needed.

---

## 7. One-Pager / Leave-Behind

### International Standards / Norms

No formal standard. De facto norms come from:
- **Sales enablement best practices** (Gartner, Forrester)
- **Startup one-pager conventions** (for fundraising)
- **Product marketing frameworks** (Positioning by April Dunford)

### Best-in-Class Examples

1. **Dock.us Revenue Archives** — 33+ real B2B one-pagers from top companies. https://www.dock.us/revenue-archives/one-pagers
2. **Dock.us Guide + Template** — Free template + best practices. https://www.dock.us/library/sales-one-pagers
3. **Zapier: 18 One-Pager Examples** — Curated gallery with analysis. https://zapier.com/blog/one-pager-examples/
4. **Shopify One-Pager Guide** — 11 types with templates. https://www.shopify.com/blog/one-pager-examples
5. **Visme Sales One-Pagers** — 11 templates with design focus. https://visme.co/blog/sales-one-pager/

### Common Structure / Pattern

```
[Header: Logo + Headline (value proposition in ≤10 words)]

[Problem: 1-2 sentences — the pain point]

[Solution: What you do + how it helps — 2-3 bullets]

[Key Benefits / Features: 3-4 bullets with icons]

[Social Proof: 1-2 customer logos + quote or metric]

[CTA: Clear next step — URL, QR code, or contact info]
```

**Design rules:**
- Maximum 60% text, 40% visual
- 3 colors maximum
- One primary CTA (not three)
- Scannable in under 30 seconds

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Headline = value proposition.** Not your company name. "Reduce churn by 40% in 90 days" beats "About Acme Corp."
2. **Problem → Solution → Proof.** This sequence never fails. Don't start with features; start with the pain.
3. **One number that matters.** "3x ROI" or "$2.4M saved for [customer]" — a single proof point that sticks.
4. **Design for the glance.** Someone should understand your value in 5 seconds of scanning. If they need to read paragraphs, redesign.
5. **Always include a clear CTA.** What should they do next? Email? QR code? Book a call? Never leave it ambiguous.

---

## 8. Executive Summary / Memo

### International Standards / Norms

| Standard | Scope | URL |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Amazon 6-Pager** | Internal decision-making memo — narrative format, no PowerPoint. Introduced by Jeff Bezos in 2004 | https://www.sixpagermemo.com |
| **Pyramid Principle** (Barbara Minto / McKinsey) | Answer-first executive communication | https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7 |
| **ISO 7144:1986** | Documentation — Presentation of theses and similar documents | https://www.iso.org/standard/13752.html |

### Best-in-Class Examples

1. **Amazon 6-Pager** — Narrative memo read silently for 20 minutes before discussion. Forces rigorous thinking. https://www.sixpagermemo.com | Guide: https://maestra.ai/blogs/how-to-write-an-amazon-6-pager | Template: https://visme.co/blog/amazon-6-pager/
2. **Jeff Bezos Annual Shareholder Letters** — Referenced as gold standard for executive writing: clear, data-driven, narrative. https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2023-letter-to-shareholders
3. **McKinsey Executive Summary Format** — Pyramid Principle: situation → complication → resolution → recommendation. https://slideworks.io/resources/the-pyramid-principle-mckinsey-toolbox-with-examples
4. **Stripe Internal Memos** — Patrick Collison's footnoted, research-paper style emails set culture. (Referenced in: https://www.mintlify.com/blog/stripe-docs)
5. **The Growth Practice: Amazon 6-Pager Analysis** — Practical guide with structure breakdown. https://thegrowthpractice.com/what-every-business-can-learn-from-the-simple-yet-effective-amazon-six-pager/

### Common Structure / Pattern

**Amazon 6-Pager Format:**
```
[Introduction: Context + the question being answered]
[Tenets: Principles guiding the proposal]
[Background / Current State: Data-driven description]
[Proposal / Body: Detailed plan with evidence]
[Questions / Open Issues: What needs to be resolved]
[Appendices: Supporting data, FAQs]
```

**McKinsey Executive Summary (SCR):**
```
[Situation: What's happening — context]
[Complication: The problem or change]
[Resolution: What we should do — recommendation]
[Evidence: Data supporting the recommendation]
```

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Answer in the first paragraph.** The executive summary IS the answer. Not "This memo will explore..." but "We recommend X because Y."
2. **Narrative > bullets.** For complex decisions, complete sentences force complete thoughts. Bezos banned PowerPoint for this reason.
3. **Anticipate the skeptic.** Address the top 3 objections before they're raised. This signals thoroughness and confidence.
4. **Data density matters.** Every claim should have a number behind it. "Revenue grew" → "Revenue grew 34% YoY to $12.4M."
5. **Keep it to the promised length.** A 6-pager that's 8 pages signals you couldn't edit. Constraint = rigor.

---

## 9. CV / Resume

### International Standards / Norms

| Standard | Scope | URL |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Europass CV** | EU-standard CV format; standardized by the European Commission | https://europass.europa.eu/en/create-europass-cv |
| **ISO 6946** | N/A (thermal standards) — No ISO specifically for resumes |
| **DIN 5008** | German standard for business correspondence formatting (applies to German CVs) | — |
| **ATS Compatibility** | De facto standard: resumes must pass Applicant Tracking Systems (plain formatting, standard headers, .docx or PDF) | — |

### Best-in-Class Examples & Resources

1. **Resume Worded — Finance Resume Templates** — 50+ finance-specific examples with ATS optimization. https://resumeworded.com/finance-resume-examples-and-templates
2. **Wall Street Oasis Resume Template** — IB/PE/VC standard: single page, 10.5pt font, quantified bullets. https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/resources/templates/word-templates/investment-banking-resume-template
3. **Mergers & Inquisitions Resume Guide** — The definitive finance resume resource. https://mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-resume-template/
4. **Harvard Business School Resume Format** — Clean, professional template widely used in finance/consulting. https://www.hbs.edu/mba/blog/post/how-to-write-a-resume-that-stands-out
5. **Europass CV Builder** — EU-standard for European applications. https://europass.europa.eu/en/create-europass-cv

### Common Structure / Pattern (VC/Finance)

```
[Name + Contact Info — clean header, no photo (US), optional photo (EU/Europass)]

[Education — school name, degree, GPA if >3.5, relevant coursework/honors]

[Professional Experience — reverse chronological]
  - Company Name | Title | Dates
  - Bullet 1: [Action verb] + [what you did] + [quantified result]
  - Bullet 2-4: Same format
  
[Additional Experience / Leadership / Extracurriculars]

[Skills & Interests — languages, technical skills, certifications]
```

**VC-specific additions:**
- Investment track record / deals sourced
- Published content / thought leadership
- Startup experience or angel investing
- Sector expertise

### 5 Template Rules

1. **One page. Period.** (For <10 years experience in US/VC.) Two pages for 15+ years in EU.
2. **Quantify everything.** Not "Led a team" but "Led 5-person team that increased deal flow 3x in 6 months." Numbers = credibility.
3. **Action verb every bullet.** "Evaluated," "Sourced," "Led," "Built," "Analyzed" — never start with "Responsible for."
4. **Tailor to the role.** One-size-fits-all resumes don't work. Reorder bullets and adjust emphasis for each application.
5. **Format for ATS + humans.** Use standard section headers (Education, Experience, Skills). Avoid tables, columns, graphics, or unusual fonts that ATS can't parse. PDF for humans, .docx for ATS.

---

## 10. Sales Proposal

| Standard | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| **APMP (Association of Proposal Management Professionals)** | Industry body for proposal best practices; certification program | https://www.apmp.org |

5. **APMP Body of Knowledge** — Industry standard for proposal excellence. https://www.apmp.org

### Common Structure (Consulting/B2B)

```
1. Executive Summary / Letter — Why you, why now, the headline impact
2. Understanding of the Challenge — Show you understand THEIR problem (not your solution)
3. Proposed Approach / Methodology — How you'll solve it, broken into phases
4. Team & Credentials — Who will do the work + relevant experience
5. Case Studies / Proof Points — 2-3 relevant examples with measurable results
6. Timeline & Milestones — Visual timeline with deliverables per phase
7. Investment / Pricing — Clear pricing structure, tied to value (not just hours)
8. Terms & Next Steps — How to proceed, what you need from them
```

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Lead with THEIR problem, not YOUR solution.** The first 2 pages should prove you understand their world. Solutions come second.
2. **Show the ROI.** If they're spending $X, show them the $3X-10X return. Every proposal is an investment decision.
3. **Include social proof.** 2-3 case studies from similar companies/situations. Logos + metrics > paragraphs of text.
4. **Make it visual.** Timelines, phase diagrams, team bios with photos. Nobody reads a 30-page text document.
5. **Clear next step on the last page.** "Sign and return by [date]" or "Let's schedule the kick-off call for [week]." Don't end with "Looking forward to hearing from you."

## 11. Technical Documentation

### International Standards / Norms

| Standard | Scope | URL |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Diátaxis Framework** | 4 types: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, Explanation | https://diataxis.fr |
| **ISO/IEC 26514:2022** | Design and development of information for users of software | https://www.iso.org/standard/77451.html |
| **ISO/IEC 18019:2004** | Guidelines for the design and preparation of user documentation for application software | — |
| **Google Developer Documentation Style Guide** | Comprehensive style guide for technical writing | https://developers.google.com/style |
| **Microsoft Writing Style Guide** | Voice, tone, and conventions for technical docs | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/ |

### Best-in-Class Examples

1. **Stripe Documentation** — The undisputed gold standard. Interactive, comprehensive, beautiful. Custom Markdoc syntax, code examples in every language, copy-paste ready. Treats docs as a product. https://docs.stripe.com | Analysis: https://www.mintlify.com/blog/stripe-docs
2. **Vercel / Next.js Documentation** — Beautiful design, progressive disclosure, excellent tutorials. https://nextjs.org/docs
3. **Anthropic Claude Documentation** — Clean, well-organized, with cookbook examples and API reference. https://docs.anthropic.com
4. **Twilio Documentation** — Pioneer of developer-first docs. Quickstarts, tutorials, and API reference with multiple language examples. https://www.twilio.com/docs
5. **Supabase Documentation** — Modern, well-structured, community-contributed. Open source docs as product. https://supabase.com/docs

### Common Structure / Pattern (Diátaxis Framework)

```
Documentation should be organized into 4 distinct types:

1. TUTORIALS — Learning-oriented
   "Let me show you how to get started"
   - Step-by-step, hands-on exercises
   - For beginners; no assumptions
   
2. HOW-TO GUIDES — Task-oriented
   "Here's how to do X"
   - Practical steps for specific goals
   - Assumes basic knowledge
   
3. REFERENCE — Information-oriented
   "Here are the details"
   - API specs, parameter lists, return types
   - Dry, accurate, comprehensive
   
4. EXPLANATION — Understanding-oriented
   "Here's why this works this way"
   - Background, context, design decisions
   - Deepens understanding
```

**What makes Stripe docs best-in-class:**
- Docs are treated as a product (not an afterthought)
- Strong writing culture starts at the CEO level
- Custom tooling (Markdoc) for interactive examples
- Templates + style guides lower the barrier for engineers to write
- Code examples in every supported language, side-by-side
- Dark mode, copy buttons, test mode toggle

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Organize by user need, not your org chart.** Use Diátaxis: tutorials for learning, how-tos for doing, reference for looking up, explanation for understanding.
2. **Show, don't just tell.** Every concept should have a code example or screenshot. Copy-paste-able code > descriptions of code.
3. **Write for the first 5 minutes.** Your quickstart guide determines whether a developer adopts or abandons your product. Make it work in <5 minutes.
4. **Keep content modular.** Each page should answer ONE question. Link to related pages instead of cramming everything into one doc.
5. **Maintain ruthlessly.** Outdated docs are worse than no docs. Every code change should trigger a docs review. Build this into CI/CD.

## 12. Meeting Prep Brief

### International Standards / Norms

No formal standard. Best practices come from:
- **Executive communication professionals** (Executive Communication Council)
- **Chiefs of Staff community** (ChiefsOfStaff.com)
- **EA/executive assistant community** best practices

### Best-in-Class Resources

5. **Visme: Executive Briefing Templates** — Templates and samples. https://visme.co/blog/how-to-write-an-executive-briefing/

### Common Structure / Pattern

```
[HEADER]
- Meeting name / purpose
- Date, time, location (or virtual link)
- Prepared by: [Name]
- Executive's role: [Speaker / Participant / Observer]

[OBJECTIVES]
- What success looks like for the exec in this meeting
- Overall meeting objective
- Key outcomes to achieve

[FORMAT & LOGISTICS]
- Duration, in-person/virtual, recorded?, open/closed
- Other participants (names, titles, relevance)
- Agenda / run of show

[ATTENDEES / KEY PEOPLE]
- For each key person: Name, title, relationship to exec, last interaction, notes
- Company background (if external meeting)
- LinkedIn or profile link

[KEY MESSAGES / TALKING POINTS]
- 3-5 messages the exec should convey
- Anticipated questions + suggested answers
- Key stats or data points to reference

[BACKGROUND / CONTEXT]
- Recent news about the person/company
- Previous meeting notes or history
- Any sensitivities or landmines

[OPEN QUESTIONS / ASKS]
- What should the exec ask?
- What might the other party ask?

[APPENDIX]
- Relevant documents, slides, or data
```

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Most critical info on page 1.** Who, what, when, where, and objectives — all above the fold. Assume they'll only read this page.
2. **Know the people.** For every attendee: name, title, last interaction, and one personal note. The exec should never be surprised by who's in the room.
3. **Anticipate, don't just inform.** Include likely questions, potential objections, and suggested responses. Reactive briefs are half as useful.
4. **1-2 pages max for the core brief.** Appendix for detail. Busy execs won't read 10 pages before a meeting.
5. **Send with the right timing.** Day before for important meetings (time to prep), morning-of for routine ones. Never day-of for complex meetings.

## 13. Deal Memo (VC)

### International Standards / Norms

No formal standard. Each VC firm has its own format. However, the following are widely recognized templates:
- **ILPA (Institutional Limited Partners Association)** — Best practices for reporting and governance
- **VC Lab Deal Memo Template** — Structured framework from VC Lab accelerator
- **Kauffman Fellows** — Deal memo frameworks taught in their program

7. **Qubit Capital: VC Investment Memos** — Structure, examples, and best practices. https://qubit.capital/blog/vc-investment-memos

### Common Structure / Pattern

```
[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]
- Company name, stage, sector
- Investment recommendation (Invest / Pass / More Diligence)
- Proposed terms: round size, valuation, investment amount, instrument

[COMPANY OVERVIEW]
- What the company does (1-2 sentences)
- Founding date, location, team size
- Funding history

[TEAM]
- Founders: background, relevant experience, founder-market fit
- Key hires and gaps

[MARKET]
- TAM / SAM / SOM
- Market dynamics and growth drivers
- Timing / "Why Now?"

[PRODUCT & TRACTION]
- Product description and differentiation
- Key metrics: ARR, MRR, growth rate, retention, unit economics
- Customer/user testimonials

[COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE]
- Key competitors and substitutes
- Moats and defensibility

[BUSINESS MODEL]
- Revenue model
- Unit economics
- Path to profitability

[RISKS & MITIGANTS]
- Top 3-5 risks
- For each: mitigation strategy or counterargument

[INVESTMENT THESIS]
- Bull case: What has to go right for 10x+ return?
- Base case: Moderate scenario
- Bear case / downside protection

[FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS / RETURN ANALYSIS]
- Exit scenarios (IPO, acquisition, secondary)
- Expected MOIC at different outcomes
- Ownership analysis

[DEAL DYNAMICS]
- Who else is in the round?
- Competitive dynamics (is this deal hot?)
- Timeline / urgency

[RECOMMENDATION]
- Clear invest/pass recommendation with reasoning
```

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Lead with the recommendation.** Don't bury it. Partners want to know: invest or pass? Then they read why.
2. **Bull case + bear case.** Every great deal memo has both. Shows intellectual honesty and rigor. Model at least 3 return scenarios (0x, 3x, 10x+).
3. **Team assessment is non-negotiable.** At seed/Series A, the team IS the investment. Go deep on founder-market fit.
4. **Use data, not adjectives.** Not "strong growth" but "3.2x YoY revenue growth, 95% net dollar retention." Numbers make memos actionable.
5. **Keep it living.** Start with a 1-pager at screening stage. Add depth through diligence. The final IC-ready memo should be 3-5 pages, not 30.

## 14. Financial Model (VC Fund)

### International Standards / Norms

| Standard | Scope | URL |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **ILPA Reporting Templates** | LP reporting best practices for private funds | https://ilpa.org/reporting-template/ |
| **GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standards)** | CFA Institute standard for investment performance reporting | https://www.gipsstandards.org |
| **RVPI / DPI / TVPI / IRR** | Industry-standard fund performance metrics | — |

### Key Metrics Every VC Fund Model Must Include

- **TVPI** (Total Value to Paid-In Capital) — total value from distributions + residual value / paid-in capital
- **DPI** (Distributions to Paid-In Capital) — actual cash returned / paid-in capital
- **RVPI** (Residual Value to Paid-In Capital) — unrealized value / paid-in capital
- **MOIC** (Multiple on Invested Capital) — total value / invested capital (deal-level)
- **IRR** (Internal Rate of Return) — time-weighted return; standard for LP reporting
- **Management Fee** — typically 2% of committed capital
- **Carried Interest** — typically 20% of profits above hurdle rate
- **J-Curve** — visualization of early losses before returns

### Best-in-Class Templates & Resources

1. **Foresight.is Venture Capital Model** — The most widely used VC fund model template. Free Google Sheets, covers fund performance, portfolio construction, LP/GP economics, all standard metrics. https://foresight.is/venture-fund-model/ | Resources: https://foresight.is/fund-resources/

5. **Graph Advisors: Free VC Fund Metrics Template** — Free calculator for TVPI, MOIC, DPI. https://graphadvisors.gumroad.com/l/VC-Fund-Metrics-TVPI-MOIC-DPI-Template | Explainer: https://graphadvisors.substack.com/p/understanding-key-vc-fund-performance

### Common Structure / Pattern

```
TAB 1: ASSUMPTIONS
- Fund size, management fee %, carry %, hurdle rate
- Investment period, fund life
- Number of investments, average check size
- Reserve ratio for follow-ons
- Graduation rates between rounds
- Expected dilution per round
- Exit timing assumptions

TAB 2: PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
- Investment-by-investment or cohort-based modeling
- Initial investment → follow-on allocations
- Ownership at entry → dilution through rounds → ownership at exit

TAB 3: EXIT SCENARIOS
- Exit multiples by outcome tier
- Exit timing (year 3-10)
- Distribution waterfall

TAB 4: FUND ECONOMICS (LP VIEW)
- Capital calls schedule
- Management fees
- Distributions timeline
- DPI, TVPI, RVPI, IRR by year

TAB 5: GP ECONOMICS
- Management company budget
- Carry accrual and distribution
- GP commit and returns

TAB 6: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
- Vary: graduation rates, exit multiples, dilution
- Show impact on TVPI and IRR
```

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Start with portfolio construction, not returns.** How many investments, what check size, how much in reserves — this determines everything else.
2. **Model failure explicitly.** Not all investments succeed. Model 50-70% total loss rates at seed, 30-40% at Series A. Realism builds LP trust.
3. **Sensitivity tables are mandatory.** Show how TVPI and IRR change with +/- 20% on key assumptions (graduation rates, exit multiples). One table tells LPs you're rigorous.
4. **Separate LP and GP economics.** LPs care about net returns after fees and carry. GPs care about management company sustainability + carry. Model both.
5. **Use industry-standard metrics.** Always include TVPI, DPI, IRR. LPs compare across funds using these. Non-standard metrics raise red flags.

## 15. Case Study (B2B)

### International Standards / Norms

No formal ISO standard for marketing case studies. Relevant frameworks:
- **HubSpot Case Study Framework** — Problem → Solution → Results
- **Salesforce Customer Success Stories** — Industry-leading format
- **Content Marketing Institute** — B2B case study best practices

### Best-in-Class Examples

1. **Salesforce Customer Success Stories** — Beautiful design, video + written format, quantified results, industry-categorized. https://www.salesforce.com/customer-success-stories/
2. **HubSpot Case Studies** — Comprehensive guide + their own case study library. Easy-to-follow format with clear metrics. https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33282/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-compelling-case-studies.aspx | Library: https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies
3. **Stripe Customer Stories** — Sleek, minimal, focused on results. Alaska Airlines Tap-to-Pay is exemplary. https://stripe.com/customers
4. **Webstacks: 14 Best B2B Case Study Examples** — Analyzed collection with breakdowns. https://www.webstacks.com/blog/b2b-case-study
5. **Mediashower: B2B Case Study Best Practices** — Practical guide with examples from top companies. https://blog-origin.mediashower.com/blog/best-practices-for-b2b-case-studies/

### Common Structure / Pattern

```
[HEADLINE: "[Customer Name] achieves [specific result] with [Your Product]"]

[SNAPSHOT / SIDEBAR]
- Company: Name, industry, size
- Challenge: 1 sentence
- Solution: 1 sentence
- Key Result: 1 headline metric (e.g., "3x increase in conversion")

[THE CHALLENGE]
- What was the customer struggling with?
- Business context and stakes
- Why existing solutions weren't working
- Quote from customer about the problem

[THE SOLUTION]
- How they discovered your product
- Implementation process
- Key features/capabilities used
- What the collaboration looked like

[THE RESULTS]
- 2-4 quantified outcomes (%, $, time saved)
- Before/after comparison
- Quote from customer about the impact
- Visual: chart, graph, or screenshot

[WHAT'S NEXT]
- Future plans with your product
- Expansion or next phase

[CTA: "See how [Product] can help your team"]
```

**Format variations:**
- **Written (long-form):** 800-1,500 words — for website/PDF
- **Video:** 2-3 minute customer testimonial — for sales enablement
- **Slide format:** 1-2 slides in a pitch deck
- **Snippet:** 2-3 sentences + metric — for email signatures, proposals

### 5 Template Rules

1. **Lead with the result in the headline.** "How [Company] Achieved 3x Growth" — not "How [Company] Uses [Product]." Results sell, features don't.
2. **Quantify everything.** Revenue increase, time saved, cost reduction, efficiency gain. "Significant improvement" means nothing. "47% reduction in onboarding time" means everything.
3. **Let the customer tell the story.** Direct quotes > your description of what happened. The customer's voice is 10x more credible than yours.
4. **Make it skimmable.** Sidebar with snapshot stats, pull quotes, bold metrics. The exec skimming in 30 seconds should still get the key message.
5. **Match the prospect's profile.** Use case studies from companies similar to your prospect (same industry, size, or challenge). Generic case studies lose deals.
