## 1. Visual Design & Format

### One Page — Non-Negotiable
- **Every credible source agrees: ONE PAGE maximum** for anyone below VP level
- "If a recruiter isn't interested in you after one page, why would they be interested after two?" — GoingVC
- "Top PE/VC firms expect a one-page resume. This isn't optional." — Leland
- **Exception:** 10+ years experience in VC → some recruiters accept 2 pages, but even then one page with a separate deal sheet is preferred (WSO thread)
- For European markets (Germany, etc.): 1 page is still the gold standard for VC specifically, even though 2-page CVs are common in corporate Germany

### Photo or No Photo?
- **US/UK:** NO photo — ever. It's considered unprofessional and creates bias liability
- **Germany/Continental Europe:** Photos are still common on CVs but **for VC firms specifically** (which tend to follow US norms), skip the photo unless the firm is explicitly traditional/German
- **Rule of thumb:** If the firm has a US-style culture (most VC firms do), no photo. If applying to a traditional German corporate VC or family office, include a professional headshot
- A photo takes valuable space on your one-page resume

### Color vs. Black & White
- **Minimal color is acceptable** — a single accent color (dark navy, charcoal blue, dark teal) for section headers or name only
- **Do NOT use flashy colors, gradients, or multi-color schemes** — it signals you don't understand finance culture
- "Use easy-to-read fonts and clear headings, avoiding flashy designs" — MyPerfectResume
- "Opt for a simple and professional design" — Private Equity List
- **Best approach:** Black text, one subtle accent color (navy/dark blue) for headers. Clean lines only.

### Fonts
- **Safe fonts for finance/VC:** Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman, Georgia
- "Choose among Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. Most finance professionals are accustomed to these three." — 10X EBITDA
- Calibri is the current industry standard for finance resumes
- Body text: **10pt** (standard) or 11pt (if you need more space)
- Headers: **12-14pt**, bold
- Name: **14-16pt**, bold, centered
- **Never go below 9pt** — "the resume will become too cluttered and won't have enough white space" — WSO

### Margins
- **0.5–0.75 inches** on all sides — Leland recommendation
- 10X EBITDA uses **0.55"** for top, bottom, left, right
- **Never go smaller than 0.4" top/bottom or 0.5" left/right**
- US: Letter size (8.5" × 11")
- Europe: A4 size

### Layout Rules
- **Single-column layout** — always. Two-column layouts confuse ATS and feel cramped
- **Reverse chronological order** — most recent first
- Clean, consistent formatting throughout: same font sizes, punctuation, capitalization, alignment
- Use horizontal lines/rules sparingly to separate sections
- Fill the page — "most of the text should take up the entire line" to create perception of meaningful experience (10X EBITDA)
- Balance text density with white space — don't leave the page half empty, but don't cram it either

---

## 2. Sections & Structure

### Recommended Section Order (for experienced professionals)

1. **Header/Contact Information**
2. **Work Experience** (50-80% of the page)
3. **Education** (~3 lines)
4. **Additional Information / Skills & Interests** (brief but meaningful)

### Header / Contact Info
- Name: Bold, centered, larger font (14-16pt)
- One line below: Email | Phone | City, State/Country | LinkedIn URL
- Optional: Personal blog/website if relevant (investment writing, etc.)
- **DO NOT include:** Full address, date of birth, marital status, photo (in US/UK context)
- Keep it to ONE compact line

### Professional Summary — CONTROVERSIAL
- **10X EBITDA & Street of Walls: DO NOT include** — "Objective and Summary sections are a waste of space and will fast track you to the ding pile"
- **Leland: No summary/objective — they waste space**
- **Himalayas & some career sites: Include** — "Two-line max; every word must earn carry"
- **VERDICT for VC:** Skip the summary for traditional finance-path candidates (IB → VC). For non-traditional candidates (founder/operator → VC), a brief 1-2 line positioning statement can be valuable to immediately signal "why VC"

### Work Experience — THE CORE
- Takes up 50-80% of your resume
- Most recent role: 4-6 bullet points
- Earlier roles: 2-3 bullet points each
- **Format per role:**
  - Company Name | Job Title | Location | Dates (right-aligned)
  - 1-2 line role summary (optional — e.g., "First-year analyst covering consumer/tech, working on 6 closed transactions totaling $2.3B")
  - 4-6 achievement bullets with metrics
- **Every bullet should:** Start with strong action verb → Describe what you did → Quantify the impact
- Strong action verbs: Sourced, Analyzed, Led, Executed, Structured, Identified, Negotiated, Built, Optimized, Developed, Spearheaded

### Education
- Keep it brief: Degree | University | Graduation Year
- Include GPA only if strong (>3.5 / top 10% equivalent)
- Relevant coursework only if early-career
- Academic honors, scholarships worth mentioning
- **For experienced professionals:** 2-3 lines max. Don't list coursework.

### Additional / Skills & Interests
- Technical skills: Excel, Python, CapIQ, PitchBook, Power BI, financial modeling
- Languages (huge differentiator in VC)
- Certifications: CFA (if relevant), relevant courses
- **Interests section:** Make it specific and memorable — not "reading, travel, sports" but "Completed 3 ultramarathons" or "Founded student investment fund, generated 11% return"
- This is where personality shows — VCs want interesting, well-rounded people

---

## 3. What VCs Scan For (The 30-Second Rule)

### The 30-Second Glance
Every source confirms: **recruiters/partners spend 30 seconds or less** reviewing your resume initially.

> "Private equity professionals and headhunters will likely spend only 30 seconds glancing your resume. If they like what they see, they might read the bullets in greater detail. If not, they probably won't spend the 31st second." — 10X EBITDA

### What They Look For (In Order)
1. **Current and previous employer names** — brand recognition matters (a16z, Goldman, McKinsey, YC-backed startup)
2. **Job titles** — role progression
3. **Educational background** — school name, degree
4. **Deal/transaction metrics** — $ amounts, returns, growth percentages visible at a glance
5. **Sector expertise** — do you match their fund's focus?

### Key Metrics That Matter Most
- **Deal volume:** "$X in total transaction value across Y deals"
- **Returns:** IRR, MOIC for investment roles
- **Growth metrics:** Revenue growth %, user growth, efficiency improvements
- **Portfolio impact:** Companies sourced, due diligence completed, board involvement
- **Quantifiable achievements:** "Grew organic users 300% in 4 months" beats "experienced marketing professional"

---

## 4. Secret Tips & Insider Knowledge

### What Makes a VC CV Stand Out From 500 Applicants

1. **Show, Don't Tell** — "Don't say you're experienced, show them. If you say 'helped a pre-seed SaaS startup grow organic users by 300% in four months,' now you've got the hiring manager thinking, 'how did they do that?'" — GoingVC

2. **Quantify Everything** — Every bullet point should have a number. No exceptions. "Built financial models" → "Built LBO and DCF models for $450M SaaS acquisition, analysis shaped final bid contributing to 3.2x MOIC"

3. **Demonstrate Passion Tangibly** — "Served as advisor to 5 fintech startups, 3 went on to get funding" or "Volunteered at 10 accelerators in 3 years" or "Made personal angel investment, wrote detailed investment memo"

4. **Mirror the Firm's Thesis** — Research the target fund's thesis, sectors, stage preference. Use their vocabulary in your bullets. "Consumer, SaaS, climate, etc. — use their keywords" — Himalayas

5. **Attach a Deal Sheet** — For experienced VC professionals: "Attach a deal sheet to resume. No names. Some valuations and investment size if public. Organize by what you did in that deal (portfolio support, DD, etc.)" — Reddit r/venturecapital

6. **Your Resume Sets Interview Topics** — "The content on the resume will often set the conversation topics of the interview. Strategically steer them in the direction of topics that will inherently benefit you." — 10X EBITDA

7. **LinkedIn Must Match** — "Most VCs will check your LinkedIn profile first. It's like a quick test to see if you pass the minimum bar or if there are any major red flags." — Growth Equity Interview Guide

### Instant Rejection Signals

1. **Typos or grammatical errors** — "Any kind of little typos or incorrect grammar is likely going to make their jobs a lot easier [to reject you]" — GoingVC
2. **Inconsistent formatting** — Different font sizes, misaligned dates, inconsistent punctuation
3. **Generic descriptions** — "Experienced marketing professional" or "passionate VC professional" = instant skip
4. **More than one page** (for associate-level)
5. **Objective/Summary section** in a traditional finance context
6. **No quantified achievements** — just listing job duties
7. **Obvious keyword stuffing** without substance
8. **Fancy design elements** — graphics, charts, colored sidebars, progress bars for skills
9. **Gaps with no explanation**
10. **Irrelevant experience taking up prime real estate**

### Do VCs Care About Design/Formatting?
**YES — but in the "attention to detail" sense, not the "creative design" sense.**
- A perfectly formatted, consistent resume signals: "This person is detail-oriented and will produce clean work product"
- Design creativity is NOT valued — clean professionalism IS
- "The correct format is critical. Making the slightest grammatical error or missing any aspect of the correct format is a fairly likely way to get your resume rejected." — Street of Walls

## 5. Positioning Founder/Operator Experience

### Why Founder Experience Is Actually a HUGE Asset

> "The hiring managers usually like young people who have had startup experience, such as being an operator." — Lucia Polverino (VC Analyst at Playfair, via Business Insider)

> "Having experience in the startup ecosystem, either as a founder or operator, is also important." — MIT Sloan CDO

> "A VC associate career typically begins with experience in related fields such as investment banking, management consulting, or operational roles at startups." — Leland

### How to Position Founder Experience for VC

1. **Lead with investor-relevant metrics:**
   - Revenue/ARR growth you drove
   - Fundraising rounds you led (amount raised, investors secured)
   - Team scaling (hired X people, grew from Y to Z)
   - Unit economics improvements
   - Customer/user metrics

2. **Frame it through the VC lens:**
   - "Built and scaled [company] from 0 to €X ARR" → shows you understand what VCs look for in portfolio companies
   - "Led Series A fundraise, securing €Xm from [notable VCs]" → shows you understand the other side of the table
   - "Managed P&L, achieving X% margin improvement" → shows financial acumen

3. **Emphasize skills that transfer directly:**
   - Due diligence perspective (you've been diligenced — you know what good looks like)
   - Financial modeling from the operator side
   - Market analysis and competitive positioning
   - Board reporting and investor relations
   - Hiring/team building (relevant to portfolio support)

4. **Show entrepreneurial mindset:**
   - Personal investments, angel deals, startup advising
   - Blog/newsletter about startups or investing
   - Startup ecosystem involvement (accelerators, events, mentoring)

### Positioning a "Failed" Startup
- Still valuable! Frame around learnings and metrics
- "Founded [company] in [sector]. Led product development, grew to X users/revenue before pivoting/winding down. Key learnings applied to..."
- VCs respect founders who tried — it shows risk tolerance and resilience

---

## 6. Investment Thesis & Deal Experience

### Should You Include an Investment Thesis on Your Resume?
- **On the resume itself:** No — there's no space for it on a one-page resume
- **In the cover letter:** YES — "Mention your investment thesis, if applicable" — Growth Equity Interview Guide
- **As a separate attachment:** Some candidates include a 1-page investment memo or thesis document
- **In your positioning:** Your professional summary or cover letter can hint at thesis: "Focused on European B2B SaaS at seed/Series A stage"
- **Best approach:** Reference your thesis/perspective in your cover letter and be ready to discuss in detail during interviews

### How to Showcase Deal Experience

**For candidates with direct VC/investing experience:**
- Use the deal bullet formula: `[Transaction Type] – [Companies Involved] – [Deal Size]: [Your Role + Outcome]`
- Show end-to-end capabilities: sourcing → due diligence → term sheet → portfolio support
- Quantify: number of deals screened, deals closed, capital deployed, returns generated
- "For early-stage VC, showcase companies sourced that made it far in the process (IC discussions, partner meetings)" — Reddit r/venturecapital

**For candidates WITHOUT direct deal experience:**
- Show proxy experience: startup advising, angel investing, investment club, competitions
- "You can go invest in an equity crowdfunding round and write up your own detailed analysis detailing why you made that investment" — GoingVC
- Financial modeling projects, market maps, or sector research

**For candidates with operating experience:**
- Frame operator work as "portfolio company experience from the inside"
- Highlight: fundraising support, financial reporting, scaling operations, M&A involvement
- This positions you as someone who can add real value to portfolio companies post-investment

## 9. Cover Letter Companion Tips

While separate from the resume, every source emphasizes the cover letter is critical for VC applications.

### Structure (from "How to Land in Venture Capital" newsletter):
1. **Why You?** — Your unique qualifications and what you bring
2. **Why Venture Capital?** — Your genuine passion and understanding
3. **Why THIS Firm?** — Research their portfolio, thesis, culture

### Key Cover Letter Tips:
- "The letter must prove you think like an investor" — Himalayas
- Open with a hook: "a startup you seeded that just hit Series B"
- Tell 2 short stories: (1) how you sourced/won a deal others passed on, (2) how you helped a founder scale
- Use numbers: check size, ARR growth, exit multiple
- Mirror the firm's thesis and use their keywords
- Mention your investment thesis if applicable
- **DO NOT** just rehash your resume — add new context and narrative
- Tailor EVERY letter to the specific firm
