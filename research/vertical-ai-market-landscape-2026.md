## 3. The "Vertical AI" Investment Thesis — VC Perspectives

### Report 1: Bessemer Venture Partners — "The Future of AI is Vertical" (2024–2025)

**Source:** [BVP Atlas — Part I: The Future of AI is Vertical](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/part-i-the-future-of-ai-is-vertical) | [State of AI 2025](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-state-of-ai-2025)

**Position: Strongly bullish on vertical AI**

**Key arguments:**
1. **"Vertical AI represents an even larger market opportunity than legacy vertical SaaS."** The top 20 public vertical SaaS companies have ~$300B combined market cap. Vertical AI can eclipse this because it automates high-cost, repetitive language-based tasks in sectors (legal, healthcare, finance) that were *out of bounds* for legacy software.

2. **New benchmark: "Q2T3" replaces "T2D3."** AI startups grow faster than SaaS predecessors. LLM-native vertical AI companies are achieving 80% of traditional SaaS ACVs, posting ~400% YoY growth, with ~65% gross margins. Bessemer expects at least 5 vertical AI firms to hit $100M+ ARR in 2-3 years.

3. **Two types of AI startups: "Supernovas" vs. "Shooting Stars."** Supernovas reach ~$40M ARR in Year 1, ~$125M in Year 2, but have only ~25% gross margins. Shooting Stars reach ~$3M Year 1, quadruple YoY, with ~60% gross margins. Both are valid but different plays.

4. **Core vs. supporting workflows:** Targeting core workflows (contract drafting for lawyers, financial modeling for bankers) faces more resistance but captures more value. Supporting workflows (marketing for dentists, procurement for shippers) have less resistance and higher initial ROI.

5. **Bessemer deployed $1B+ into AI-native startups since 2023.** Their portfolio includes Abridge, EvenUp, and others. They characterize vertical AI as having "the most potential for change" among all AI categories.

### Report 2: Sequoia Capital — "AI in 2025: Building Blocks Firmly in Place" (Dec 2024)

**Source:** [Sequoia — AI in 2025](https://sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2025/)

**Position: Cautiously optimistic — focused on the application layer**

**Key arguments:**
1. **"Act Three" of generative AI = vertical agents.** Sequoia's Sonya Huang frames AI evolution in three acts: Act One (ChatGPT/generation), Act Two (reasoning models/multimodal), Act Three (2025+) = vertical AI agents trained end-to-end for specific workflows using RL, synthetic data, and user feedback.

2. **2025 is the year of sifting.** "If 2024 was about new ideas abounding, 2025 will be about sifting through those ideas to see which really work." Sequoia emphasizes that every industry — from healthcare to law to insurance — now has AI initiatives, but not all will survive.

3. **Foundation model differentiation creates opportunity for vertical players.** As Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and xAI pursue different strategies (vertical integration, brand, talent, etc.), this creates diverse infrastructure for vertical AI builders to leverage.

4. **Revenue ≠ durability.** Sequoia warns that "buyers are hungry, AI demos dazzle, sales can spike, but not all products deliver real value. Retention can be fragile, especially when switching costs are low."

### Report 3: Greylock — "Tomorrow's Titans: Vertical AI" (Feb 2025) + NEA Framework

**Source:** [Greylock — Vertical AI](https://greylock.com/greymatter/vertical-ai/) (Oct 2024) | [NEA — Tomorrow's Titans: Vertical AI](https://www.nea.com/blog/tomorrows-titans-vertical-ai) (Feb 2025)

**Position: Strongly bullish — vertical AI = "the next titans of software"**

**Key arguments (Greylock):**
1. **Better data > better models.** The most important differentiator in vertical AI is data, not model sophistication. Companies should build proprietary data assets where product usage itself generates unique datasets (flywheel effect).

2. **Unstructured data is the unlock.** 80% of the world's data is unstructured. LLMs can now tackle contracts, records, and multimedia — unlocking industries that legacy SaaS couldn't serve.

3. **TAM paradox:** Smaller TAMs are both a bug and a feature. Fewer funded competitors, deeper market concentration, and advantaged distribution. In fragmented sectors like healthcare, even "narrow" focus can yield massive markets.

**Key arguments (NEA):**
4. **"The nature of software is changing from a system of record to a system of actions."** Vertical AI shifts the control point from traditional systems of record (Salesforce, Workday) to agentic layers that execute tasks. This fundamentally redefines competitive dynamics.

5. **$11T US labor spend is the real TAM.** Enterprise software market is ~$450B, but vertical AI agents can tap into the $11T labor spend. "Software" that replaces human labor captures far more value than software that merely organizes information.

6. **Perfect storm: declining AI costs + labor shortages.** Foundation model competition is driving down the marginal cost of intelligence, while critical industries face acute labor shortages (only 38% of Americans have 4-year degrees). Vertical AI agents are the antidote.

### Bonus: Insight Partners — "Building a Moat in the Age of AI" (Nov 2025)

**Source:** [Insight Partners — Building a Moat](https://www.insightpartners.com/ideas/building-a-moat-in-the-age-of-ai/) (Nov 2025)

**Key insight:** "Two major categories where vertical AI companies can build real moats: **workflow depth** and **proprietary data**. A chat window fine-tuned by prompt engineers and industry experts might get you early adoption, but not defensibility." Advocates for the forward-deployed engineering (FDE) model (à la Palantir) for vertical AI companies.

## 4. What Differentiates Winners from Losers?

### 🏆 Patterns of WINNING Vertical AI Companies

Based on analysis of successful companies (Harvey, Abridge, EvenUp, Tempus, Augury) and VC frameworks (Bessemer, Greylock, Insight Partners, NEA):

#### 1. Workflow Depth > Feature Breadth
- **Winners** embed deeply into core workflows and become the "system of actions" users live in daily
- **Losers** build thin wrappers or "copilot" chat interfaces on top of generic LLMs
- **Example:** Abridge doesn't just transcribe — it integrates directly into Epic's EHR, generating structured clinical notes that feed into billing, coding, and CDI workflows. Switching costs become enormous.
- *"A chat window fine-tuned by prompt engineers and industry experts might get you early adoption, but not defensibility."* — Insight Partners

#### 2. Proprietary Data Flywheel
- **Winners** build systems where product usage generates unique, hard-to-replicate datasets that improve the product
- **Losers** rely on publicly available data or generic fine-tuning
- **Example:** Tempus AI has built one of the world's largest clinico-genomic datasets through its testing relationships with hospitals. Every test generates data that makes the platform smarter. Augury's IoT sensors continuously collect unique machine health data from manufacturing floors.
- **The flywheel:** Initial data access → better product → more customers → more data → better product → moat

#### 3. Domain-Specific Go-to-Market (Not SaaS Playbook)
- **Winners** adopt market-shaping GTM, building category authority before competitors can define the space
- **Losers** copy SaaS playbooks (outbound sequences, demo-first sales, top-of-funnel optimization)
- **Key challenge in 2026:** AI startup funding surged 85% to $211B in 2025, but enterprise IT budgets grew only 2%. Enterprises are consolidating AI vendors — spending more with fewer providers. 99.5% of AI startups will fail to reach $10M revenue (per Northern Pixels analysis).
- **Source:** [The AI Insider (Jan 2026)](https://theaiinsider.tech/2026/01/17/guest-post-three-gtm-challenges-killing-vertical-ai-startups-in-2026/)

#### 4. Regulatory/Compliance Moats
- **Winners** in legal and healthcare leverage regulatory complexity as a competitive advantage. Compliance requirements (HIPAA, legal privilege, bar regulations) create massive barriers for horizontal AI players
- **Losers** treat regulation as an afterthought
- **Example:** Hippocratic AI's entire positioning is "clinically safe" AI — they won't touch diagnostic tasks. This safety-first approach builds trust with risk-averse health systems.

#### 5. Vertical-Specific Business Models
- **Winners** move beyond SaaS subscriptions toward outcome-based or usage-based pricing that captures more value
- **Losers** price per seat in markets where AI reduces headcount (self-defeating pricing)
- **Example:** EvenUp's value proposition is directly tied to case outcomes — higher demand letter values for PI lawyers. Harvey can charge based on matters completed, not seats filled.
- *Bessemer: "LLM-native companies are achieving 80% of traditional SaaS ACVs with ~400% YoY growth."*

#### 6. Hardware + Software Integration (Manufacturing)
- **Winners** in manufacturing combine physical sensing (IoT/sensors) with AI software, creating moats that pure-software competitors can't replicate
- **Losers** try to do manufacturing AI purely as a SaaS play without shop floor presence
- **Example:** Augury combines proprietary vibration sensors with AI algorithms. Bright Machines integrates robotics hardware with software-defined automation. The hardware layer collects unique data and creates switching costs.

### 💀 Patterns of FAILING Vertical AI Companies

#### 1. The "Thin Wrapper" Trap
- Companies that build a UI on top of GPT-4/Claude with industry-specific prompts. Initial growth can be deceptive (easy to demo, buyers eager to try) but no defensibility. Foundation model providers are moving up the stack.
- *"Wrapper accusations persist — focus should be on building robust moats via sector-specific knowledge and integration."* — Bessemer

#### 2. Misleading Growth Signals
- AI startups can achieve "supernova" growth ($40M ARR in Year 1) but with 25% gross margins and fragile retention. Some are trading distribution for profit in ways that may not be sustainable.
- *"Early hypergrowth alone means less now than ever before."* — Bessemer State of AI 2025

#### 3. Crowded Categories with No Differentiation
- 2-3x more competitors in promising AI categories vs. prior eras. If you're not one of the 2-3 "safe choice" vendors in your category by 2026, you won't get budget allocation. Enterprise AI budgets are consolidating.

#### 4. Ignoring the "Last Mile" of Industry Integration
- Vertical AI that doesn't integrate with existing industry infrastructure (EHR systems in healthcare, practice management in legal, MES/SCADA in manufacturing) will fail to get adopted, regardless of AI quality.

#### 5. Underestimating Incumbents
- Legacy SaaS giants (Thomson Reuters, LexisNexis in legal; Epic, Cerner in healthcare; Siemens, Rockwell in manufacturing) are rapidly building AI features into existing platforms. They own the workflow and customer relationships. Startups must complement, not compete head-on.

## Appendix: Key Thesis Takeaways for "AI-Native Vertical Software" Fund

### The Bull Case (Why Now)
1. **Massive TAMs unlocking:** Combined $300B+ across legal, manufacturing, and healthcare AI by 2030
2. **Labor market TAM:** Vertical AI accesses the $11T US labor spend, not just the $450B enterprise software market
3. **Speed of value creation:** Harvey (3 years → $8B), Abridge (7 years → $5.3B) — fastest wealth creation in software history
4. **Incumbents are slow:** Legal tech spending grew fastest ever in 2025 (9.7% YoY) — signal that industry is just waking up
5. **Strong VC consensus:** Bessemer, Greylock, NEA, Sequoia, Insight Partners all publishing bullish theses on vertical AI

### The Bear Case (Risks)
1. **Foundation model risk:** OpenAI, Google, Anthropic moving up the stack into applications — could eat the application layer
2. **Gross margin compression:** AI inference costs, especially for "supernova" companies, can push margins to 25% or negative
3. **Competitive intensity:** 2-3x more competitors per category. 99.5% of AI startups will fail to reach $10M revenue
4. **Regulatory uncertainty:** Healthcare and legal face evolving AI regulations that could slow adoption or increase compliance costs
5. **Buyer fatigue:** Enterprises are overwhelmed with AI vendors and consolidating spend to fewer providers

### Fund Strategy Implications
- **Target "Shooting Stars" over "Supernovas":** Companies with ~60% gross margins, 4x YoY growth, and deep workflow integration > flashy hypergrowth with negative margins
- **Look for data flywheels and hardware integration:** Proprietary data generation through product usage. In manufacturing: sensor + software combos
- **Invest at the workflow layer, not the chat layer:** System of actions > copilot. Companies users live in all day
- **Healthcare has the most capital deployed; Legal has the most attractive startup dynamics**
- **Manufacturing is underfunded relative to TAM:** $155B market by 2030 but far fewer startups than healthcare or legal
