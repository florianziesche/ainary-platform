## The Three Core Problems

### 1. Massive Sales Cycle
Enterprise manufacturing = 6-18 months from first contact to deployment. POC hell: free pilots that never convert. Multiple stakeholders (Quality, Production, IT, Procurement, C-level). Every deal requires custom integration work.

### 2. Vision Isn't Big Enough
"AI visual inspection" is a feature, not a company. Cognex, Landing AI, Keyence, and dozens of others all claim the same thing. Hard to differentiate on tech alone. Investors see a crowded category.

### 3. "AI" Isn't a Differentiator Anymore
Every manufacturing software vendor has "AI" on their website now. The word lost its meaning. Buyers are skeptical. "AI-powered" triggers eye-rolls in procurement.

---

## The Strategic Shift: From Inspection Tool → Manufacturing Quality Intelligence

The inspection is data capture. The real value is what you DO with that data.

### Current positioning (weak):
> "We detect defects with AI."

### Target positioning (strong):
> "We eliminate defects before they happen and capture manufacturing knowledge before it retires."

---

## 7 Concrete Recommendations

### 1. Rebrand from "Inspection" to "Quality Intelligence"

Stop competing with Landing AI and Cognex on inspection features. Compete on outcomes.

**From:** "Technology leader for AI-based visual quality inspection"
**To:** "Manufacturing Quality Intelligence — from defect detection to defect prevention"

Nobody buys "inspection." They buy: fewer recalls, lower scrap, audit compliance, and keeping production running. Sell the outcome.

### 2. Add "WHY It Failed" to "WHAT Failed"

This is the single biggest product unlock.

**Current:** "This brake disc has a crack." → Reactive.
**Next:** "This brake disc has a crack because spindle temperature exceeded 180°C at 14:32. Recommend recalibration." → Predictive + prescriptive.

How: Connect inspection results to process parameters (temperature, pressure, speed, tool wear). Correlate defect patterns to upstream causes. This turns a $50K/year inspection tool into a $500K/year process optimization platform.

**Closed-loop quality:** Inspect → Diagnose → Prescribe → Adjust → Verify.

This is where every competitor ISN'T. Landing AI does detection. Cognex does detection. Nobody does the closed loop.

### 3. Product-Led Growth (PLG) via Marketplace

Menlo Ventures found 27% of enterprise AI spend now enters through PLG — 4x the rate in traditional SaaS. AI applications convert at 41% vs. SaaS' 25%.

**Concrete:**
- **1-click install in Bosch ctrlX World** (partnership already exists)
- **SAP Store listing** (partnership already exists)
- **Siemens MindSphere / Industrial Edge** marketplace
- **Pre-trained model library:** Customer picks industry (automotive, electronics, pharma), downloads a pre-trained model, customizes with 5 images. Time to value: hours, not months.

This kills the sales cycle. The quality engineer tries it Tuesday, shows results to their boss Wednesday, procurement approves Friday. No 12-month evaluation.

### 4. Usage-Based or Outcome-Based Pricing

**Current (guessed):** Annual SaaS subscription → requires procurement approval → 6-month cycle.

**Alternative:**
- **Per-inspection pricing:** €0.01/part inspected. Zero upfront commitment. Scale with production volume.
- **Outcome-based:** "Pay only for defects we catch that your current system misses." Risk = 0 for buyer. CFO-friendly.
- **Freemium:** 1,000 inspections/month free. Prove value first. Self-serve upgrade.

Outcome-based pricing collapses the sales cycle because procurement's #1 objection ("what if it doesn't work?") disappears.

### 5. Fachkräftemangel Positioning (German Market)

13-20 million workers retire by 2036 in Germany. Manufacturing knowledge walks out the door. This is emotionally urgent and financially terrifying for every Mittelstand CEO.

**Positioning:**
> "Your best quality inspector retires in 3 years. We capture their knowledge in 3 days."

36ZERO already does this implicitly — the AI learns from expert-labeled images. Make it EXPLICIT. Build a "Knowledge Capture" workflow: bring your retiring expert, have them label 20 images of common defects, train the model, their 30 years of experience is now digitized forever.

This sells itself at trade fairs. It's press-worthy. It's emotionally resonant. And it's true.

### 6. Expand Into Regulated Industries

**Pharma, medtech, aerospace, food & beverage.** Inspection isn't optional — it's legally mandated. Failure costs millions (recalls, FDA warnings, lawsuits).

Why this helps the sales cycle:
- Compliance is non-negotiable → budget is pre-approved
- Decision-maker is clear (Quality/Regulatory, not committee)
- Willingness to pay is 3-5x manufacturing
- Switching cost is high once you're in → retention moat

36ZERO's no-code platform + data efficiency is PERFECTLY suited for regulated environments where you can't get 10,000 defect samples.

### 7. Build the Quality Data Moat

Every inspection generates data. Aggregate it.

**Cross-plant benchmarking:** "Your Munich plant has 2.3% scrap rate. Industry average is 3.1%. Your Ingolstadt plant is at 4.7% — here's why."

**Supplier quality scoring:** "Supplier A's parts have 0.5% defect rate. Supplier B has 2.1%. Here's the data."

**Predictive defect forecasting:** "Based on current process drift, expect 15% increase in surface defects within 72 hours."

This data is the moat. No competitor has it if 36ZERO moves fast. And once a customer is contributing data to the network, they never leave — because the intelligence gets better with scale.

## The Big Vision (Investor Pitch)

> **36ZERO Vision is building the operating system for manufacturing quality.** We started with visual inspection because it's the #1 pain point — manual, subjective, expensive, and about to lose its workforce to retirement. But inspection is just data capture. The real product is Manufacturing Quality Intelligence: connecting what we see on the production line to why it happened and how to prevent it. We turn reactive quality control into autonomous quality management. Our moat is data — every inspection trains the network, and the network gets smarter with every customer. We're not selling AI. We're selling zero-defect manufacturing.

## Priority Matrix

| Action | Impact | Effort | Timeline |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Rebrand to Quality Intelligence | High | Low | 1 month |
| PLG via existing marketplaces | High | Medium | 2-3 months |
| Usage-based pricing option | High | Medium | 1-2 months |
| Fachkräftemangel positioning | High | Low | 2 weeks |
| Process parameter correlation | Very High | High | 6-12 months |
| Regulated industry expansion | High | Medium | 3-6 months |
| Quality Data Moat / benchmarking | Very High | High | 6-12 months |

**Quick wins (next 30 days):** Rebrand messaging, Fachkräftemangel angle, usage-based pricing pilot.
**Medium-term (90 days):** PLG marketplace listings, regulated industry first customer.
**Long-term (12 months):** Process correlation product, data moat.

## TL;DR

36ZERO's problem isn't technology — the tech is genuinely differentiated (5 images, pixel-level, no-code). The problem is positioning and GTM.

**Stop selling:** "We do AI visual inspection."
**Start selling:** "We eliminate defects and capture manufacturing knowledge before it retires."

The sales cycle shrinks when you:
1. Let the product sell itself (PLG via marketplaces)
2. Remove buyer risk (outcome-based pricing)
3. Sell urgency, not features (Fachkräftemangel)
4. Sell to buyers who MUST buy (regulated industries)

The vision scales when you go from "inspection tool" to "quality intelligence platform" — and the moat deepens with every customer's data.
