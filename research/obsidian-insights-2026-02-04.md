# Obsidian Vault Deep Analysis — 2026-02-04

*Compiled by Mia (subagent) | Full vault read + workspace cross-reference*

---

## Executive Summary

The Obsidian vault is well-structured but **young** (mostly created 2026-02-01/02). It was scaffolded during the initial OpenClaw setup sessions. Many files are templates or stubs waiting to be filled. The real gold is in: 90-Day Goals, the VC Intelligence digest, the People notes, and the Content-Engine strategy. Several files exist in both Obsidian and workspace with different versions — needs consolidation.

**Key finding:** The vault has significant scaffolding but thin content in critical areas (Lessons, Fundraising Mistakes, Content drafts). The workspace has actually moved ahead of Obsidian in several areas.

---

## 1. Revenue & Strategy Insights

### 90-Day Goals (THE Master Document)
- **3 Primary Outcomes:** VC Offer, €4,500/mo revenue, 500 Substack subs
- **Revenue breakdown:** ALG1 €2,700 + CNC €750 + Consulting €1,000 + Content €500
- **Weekly scorecard system** with App/Outreach/Content/Calls/Revenue tracking
- **Status as of Feb 3:** All at zero except some content published
- **Big Day Feb 3:** Onkel meeting 12:00, Monique meeting 18:00 — these should be DONE by now

### Revenue-Targets-2026.md — EMPTY FILE (0 bytes)
- 🔴 **Gap:** This should be a key strategic document. Currently just a placeholder.

### Freelance-Pipeline.md — EMPTY FILE (0 bytes)  
- 🔴 **Gap:** No freelance tracking in Obsidian. Workspace has AI Consulting one-pager but no pipeline tracker.

### Content-Engine.md — EMPTY FILE (0 bytes)
- The real content strategy is in `30-Content/_Index.md` (comprehensive posting schedule, pillars, weekly rhythm)

### 100x Compound System Vision
- Core philosophy: "Systems in place → 100x outperformance over time"
- Compound loop: Input → Capture → Connect → Compound → Output → Feedback
- North Star Metric: **Time Leverage Ratio** (hours output value ÷ hours input work) — Target 10:1 → 100:1
- **Actionable:** This philosophy should inform everything we build. Not just theory.

### Website + CRM Setup
- Decision made: HubSpot Free + simple landing page
- Domain options considered: florianziesche.com, fz.vc, ziesche.vc
- Tech stack options: Framer, Carrd, Super.so, Custom Next.js
- **Status check needed:** Did HubSpot get set up? Did domain get purchased? Timeline said "this week" (week of Feb 1).

## 2. VC Career Insights

### Pipeline Status (from Obsidian)
| Stage | Count | Details |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Ready to Apply | 1 | Decile Capital Resident |
| Researching | 3 | HOF Capital, Primary VP, Betaworks |
| Applied | 0 | — |
| Interviewing | 0 | — |

### HOF Capital (Priority Target)
- **Multi-stage VC**, NYC, ~50 employees, 200+ family office LPs
- **"March to Abundance"** thesis — AI, FinTech, Biotech, BCI
- Portfolio includes SpaceX, Neuralink, Databricks, Klarna
- Key people: Hisham Elhaddad (Managing Partner), Marc Busch (Principal), Vivian Shi (VP)
- **Fit score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐** — Explicitly values operators + AI builders
- **Action needed:** LinkedIn engagement → cold outreach. Research their "Tomorrow Talk" podcast.

### Decile Capital
- Resident Program — good entry point for career switchers
- Application was supposed to submit Feb 3
- **Status check needed:** Did this get submitted?

### Target Funds List (from 20-Knowledge/VC/)
Full list beyond pipeline: HOF, Primary VP, Betaworks, First Round, Equal Ventures, Comcast Ventures
- Also legal tech fallbacks: Harvey, Centari, Litera, DISCO, Patlytics

### Workspace has gone further:
- `VC-FUND-RESEARCH-AI.md` — 5 additional AI funds (Conviction, AIX, Air Street, SignalFire, AV)
- `vc-applications-ready.md` — comprehensive ready-to-apply package
- `READY-TO-APPLY.md` — updated application materials
- **Obsidian is behind workspace on VC applications**

### Recruiters (Important — underutilized)
- **Pact and Partners** — German tech talent in NYC (PERFECT fit)
- Dynamics Search Partners — PE/VC NYC
- The Oxbridge Group — Venture associate placements
- GACC Talent Network — free registration
- **🔴 Action needed:** Has Florian contacted ANY of these? This is low-hanging fruit.

---

## 3. People & Relationships

### Monique Barbanson (Key Contact)
- Angel Investor / Venture Fellow @ Venture Institute
- Fund: Entelechy Ventures (AI-native B2B)
- MS CS (AI) Yale, 20 years enterprise data/AI, ex-Microsoft, ex-Affirm
- Has patents (video streaming, UI legibility)
- Founded Startup Monthly (2009-2011) — Lean Startup accelerator
- **Why she matters:** She REACHED OUT to Florian after seeing his AI workflow in VC Lab WhatsApp. That's genuine interest.
- Meeting was Feb 3, 6 PM CET
- **Status check needed:** How did this meeting go? This is potentially the most valuable connection.

### Andreas Brand (Uncle — CNC Customer)
- Owner of Maschinenbau Schlottwitz GmbH & Co. KG
- Address: Liebstädter Str. 3, 01768 Glashütte (Schlottwitz)
- Phone: (035053) 412-0
- **Demo meeting was Feb 2/3** — Status check needed
- Proposed deal: €5-10K setup + €500-750/mo
- **Revenue impact if closed:** 50% of income gap covered

### People NOT in Workspace (Obsidian only)
- **Conor** — Venture Institute connection (mentioned in Task Master)
- **Yashodhana** — VC Lab peer, NYC event organizer
- **Daniel** — Networking contact, virtual coffee
- **Tomasz Tunguz** — Not a personal contact but important thought leader to engage with for content

### Missing People Notes
- No notes for Nancy's professional contacts (could be useful for NYC return)
- No VC Lab cohort members documented (except Monique, Yashodhana)
- No Alchemist contacts documented (Florian is a coach there — unpaid, credibility)

---

## 4. CNC/Manufacturing

### Product Status
- HTML/JS single-file app (104KB SaaS)
- Features: Time calculation, quote generator, manufacturing instructions (Fertigungsanweisung)
- Planned tech stack: React/Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, CAD parsing, Heidenhain NC format
- **Currently pure frontend — no backend, no database**

### Workspace vs Obsidian
- **Workspace is WAY ahead:** Full deployment guide, Cloudflare setup, competitor analysis, sales targets, cold outreach list, 12 regional leads, pricing, ROI calculator, ISO 27001 docs, SEO/SEA plan
- **Obsidian has:** Overview, demo script, basic proposal
- **CNC-Planner-Feedback.md exists but is iCloud-locked** — may have important post-demo feedback

### Regional Leads (iCloud-locked)
- File exists at `Maschinenbau-Schlottwitz/regional-leads.md` but couldn't be read
- Workspace `COLD-OUTREACH-LIST.md` likely has the same/more leads

### Revenue Projection
- Conservative: €13,250 Year 1 (€5K setup + €750/mo × 11)
- At 50 customers × €49-149/mo: €29,400 - €89,400/year
- **This is the fastest path to real revenue**

---

## 5. Ainary Ventures

### Fund Overview
- Thesis: AI-first startups, vertical AI, proprietary data moats
- Differentiators: Technical founder perspective, operator experience, AI-native operations
- Target: $10-25M fund, $250-500K checks, Pre-seed to Seed, US + Europe
- Brand: Physics-inspired (spacetime curvature, quantum)
- **Status: Thesis in progress, everything else not started**
- **Key insight:** Fund launch is AFTER VC role (learn the business first)

### LLC Registration Research Done
- Options: NY ($200), Delaware (investor-friendly), Wyoming (low fees)
- Also: Stripe Atlas, Clerky, ZenBusiness for formation
- **Important:** Investors prefer C-Corps for funds — needs lawyer consultation
- **Not urgent** — this is post-VC-role

---

## 6. Content Pipeline

### Blog Drafts in Obsidian (6 files)
1. **"6 Ways Companies Die in the AI Era"** — FULL DRAFT, ready to edit & publish
   - Based on Tomasz Tunguz analysis
   - Strong framework, actionable, good hook
   - Distribution plan included (Substack + LinkedIn + Twitter)
2. **"The One Skill That Changed How I Work with AI"** (Substack Launch Post) — FULL DRAFT
   - WHO-WHAT-WHY-HOW prompting framework
   - ~700 words, personal story, clear CTA
   - 3 title options
   - **May already be published as the German version**
3. **"Compound AI Stack"** — iCloud-locked, couldn't read
4. **"Microsoft Concentration Risk"** — iCloud-locked
5. **"Specialist AI Wins"** — iCloud-locked
6. **Blog Outline Template** — reusable structure for all posts

### Content Strategy (30-Content/_Index.md)
- **LinkedIn:** 3-4x/week, Di+Do 08:30 CET, text posts + carousels
- **Substack:** 1x/week, Di or Do 10:00 CET, long-form
- **Twitter/X:** 5-7x/week, 15-17:00 CET
- 4 pillars: AI & Work, Founder → VC, AI Trends, Tools & Tactics
- **Gap in Obsidian:** No German-language AI/VC newsletter exists — opportunity identified

### Workspace has more content:
- 8 LinkedIn posts ready
- Twitter thread (AI Chief of Staff)
- Substack #3 outline
- Substack posting dashboard (HTML)
- Content calendar (HTML + MD)
- Gumroad CEO Framework listing

### Content Ideas from VC Intelligence Digest
1. "What Microsoft's OpenAI Dependency Teaches Startups"
2. "The Specialist Strategy: Why Vertical AI Wins"  
3. "Six Ways AI Companies Die" (draft exists!)
4. "Where RL Moats Actually Form"
5. "2026 ist das Jahr der Ein-Personen-Firma"

---

## 7. Knowledge Base

### VC Intelligence System (Impressive)
- Weekly digest system: 144 articles scanned in W05
- 10 RSS feeds tracked (Sequoia, YC, Greylock, Tunguz, Not Boring, Lenny, Stratechery, Newcomer, The Generalist, Sam Altman)
- Key insights extracted into structured notes
- **This is a real compound advantage** — but needs to be maintained weekly

### Key Research Insights
1. **AI Scaffolding Shift:** Tool-calling >90% accuracy → specialist agents > monoliths
2. **Microsoft/OpenAI Concentration Risk:** 45% of $625B commercial RPO from one customer
3. **Dead Companies Walking:** 6 failure modes in AI era (41% AI spend is net new budget!)
4. **RL Moats (Greylock):** Proprietary data + context = defensibility
5. **SOTA Feb 2026:** World Models (next frontier), Specialized Models winning, One-Person Company trend

### VC Tech Pain Points (Gold for Applications)
- Comprehensive mapping of VC workflow problems → startup opportunities
- Priority matrix with Florian's edge assessment
- Quick win ideas: Thesis Alignment Scorer, Reference Call Synthesizer, Founder Update Generator
- **This could become a product or talking point in interviews**

### Substack Recommendations (Content Sources)
- Tier 1: Newcomer, The Generalist, Strictly VC
- Tier 2: One Useful Thing (Mollick), AI Supremacy, Interconnects
- Tier 3: Agentic AI Weekly, Decision Intelligence (Kozyrkov)
- **Key insight:** "Fast keine deutschen AI-VC Newsletter" — positioning opportunity

### Prompts Library
- Executive Research System, Fund Research, Asset Builder, Extract Conversation Learnings
- Atlas System prompt
- **Organized but thin** — needs more prompts added from real usage

---

## 8. Lessons Learned (THIN — Needs Work)

### What Exists
- **Claude Learnings** — Empty template, waiting for extracts
- **Fundraising Lessons** — Has some content:
  - Compound Knowledge Architecture (capture → connect → compound → output)
  - Founder-to-employee transition is hard and normal
  - Job search = sales pipeline
  - Technical differentiator: Legal AI RAG <0.2% hallucination
  - Expert Archivist paradigm for legal AI
- **Fundraising Mistakes** — TEMPLATE ONLY, no actual mistakes filled in
  - Has the structure but Florian hasn't written the content
  - **🔴 This is a goldmine waiting to be filled.** 5 years of startup lessons are in his head, not on paper.

### Missing Lesson Files (listed in index but don't exist)
- Hiring-Lessons
- Pivot-Decisions
- Founder-Psychology
- RAG-Implementation
- Prompt-Engineering
- AI-Product-Pitfalls
- Investor-Psychology
- What-VCs-Miss
- Fundraising-From-Both-Sides
- Decision-Making
- Productivity-Systems
- Parenting-While-Building

**🔴 CRITICAL GAP:** Florian's biggest competitive advantage (5 years of lessons) is mostly undocumented. These lessons are literally listed as "your moat" in the index but the files don't exist.

## 10. Contradictions & Conflicts

### Obsidian vs Workspace
| Topic | Obsidian Says | Workspace Says | Reality |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Revenue target | €4,500/mo | €500K ASAP | Both true — different timeframes |
| CNC pricing | €500-750/mo | Pro €49/mo, Business €149/mo | Workspace has evolved pricing |
| VC pipeline | 1 ready, 3 researching | 5+ AI funds researched, multiple ready | Workspace ahead |
| Content published | 1 German Substack | 8 LinkedIn posts, Twitter thread, Substack #3 | Workspace ahead |
| Fund name | Ainary Ventures | Ainary Ventures | Consistent ✅ |
| Current income | €3K/mo freelance (USER.md) | €0 revenue (90-Day Goals) | Unclear — need clarification |

### Duplicated Information

- VC Tech Pain Points: In `20-Knowledge/VC/` AND `20-Knowledge/VC-Tech-Problems/` (duplicate files)
- CNC leads: In Obsidian `regional-leads.md` AND workspace `COLD-OUTREACH-LIST.md`

### Empty/Stub Files in Obsidian
These exist as 0-byte files (created but never written):
- Revenue-Targets-2026.md
- Freelance-Pipeline.md
- Content-Engine.md (root level — real content is in 30-Content/)

## 13. Actionable Intelligence — What Can We Use TODAY?

### Immediate Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Check Monique meeting outcome** — This was Feb 3. If it went well, follow-up is critical. She reached out to HIM — that's rare and valuable.

2. **Check Decile application** — Was it submitted Feb 3? If not, do it NOW.

3. **Check Onkel/CNC demo outcome** — Was Feb 2/3. Did it happen? Feedback? Next steps?

4. **Contact Pact and Partners recruiter** — They specifically place German tech talent in NYC. This is the lowest-hanging fruit for job search and hasn't been done.

5. **Publish "6 Ways Companies Die" blog post** — Full draft exists, just needs editing. High-quality content ready to go.

6. **Register on GACC Talent Network** — Free, takes 5 minutes, explicitly for German professionals in NYC.

7. **Fill in Fundraising Mistakes** — The template exists but is empty. This is Florian's actual competitive moat and it's undocumented.

8. **Send CNC outreach emails** — 5 personalized emails are ready in workspace. Just needs sending.

### Weekly Rhythm Suggestions
- Sunday: Content prep + VC Intelligence digest
- Monday: LinkedIn post + 3 outreach messages
- Tuesday: Substack publish + Twitter thread
- Wednesday: LinkedIn post + follow-ups
- Thursday: LinkedIn post + Substack (option B)
- Friday: Review week, update pipeline, prep next week

## 15. Proposed Updates to MEMORY.md

### Add to Key People section:

```markdown
## Recruiter Network (Untapped)
- **Pact and Partners** — German tech talent in NYC (HIGHEST PRIORITY — perfect fit)
- **Dynamics Search Partners** — PE/VC placements NYC
- **The Oxbridge Group** — Venture associate placements
- **Ratio** — Early-stage investing roles
- **GACC Talent Network** — Free registration: german-american-chambers-of-commerce.breezy.hr
- **GACCNY Job Board** — gaccny.com/us/jobs-education (check weekly)
- **STATUS:** NONE CONTACTED YET as of Feb 4
```

### Add to Active Threads:

```markdown
- **DepoDigest** — Legal AI platform, US law firm focus (NYC). Mentioned in task lists but no dedicated documentation. Needs project brief.

- **HubSpot CRM** — Decided on Feb 1, unknown if set up
- **Website domain** — florianziesche.com (or alternatives) — status unknown
```

### Add to Lessons Learned:

```markdown
- **Obsidian vs Workspace divergence** — Obsidian is scaffolded but static; workspace moves fast. Risk: information split. Solution: Obsidian = knowledge base + thinking. Workspace = operations + outputs. Don't duplicate.
- **Recruiter outreach = low effort, high ROI** — 9 relevant recruiters identified, zero contacted. This is a systematic blindspot.
- **Lessons files = empty moat** — The "60-Lessons" folder is Florian's declared competitive advantage but 12/14 files don't exist. Need to extract lessons from conversations and experience.
- **Content drafts exist but don't ship** — Multiple blog posts drafted, LinkedIn posts written, but publishing cadence not yet established.
```

### Add to Core Frameworks:

```markdown
- **Time Leverage Ratio** — North Star from 100x Vision: Hours of output value ÷ Hours of input work. Target: 10:1 → 100:1.
- **VC Tech Pain Points Matrix** — Mapped opportunities where technical + business + operator background = unique edge. Use in interviews.
```

   - 6+ regional leads identified
   - Full deployment package ready
   - Fastest path to revenue after ALG1
```

### Add to Key People:

```markdown
- **Andreas Brand** — Uncle, owns Maschinenbau Schlottwitz, CNC pilot customer. Phone: (035053) 412-0
- **Monique Barbanson** — Entelechy Ventures, AI investor, Yale CS, reached out to Florian (warm lead)
- **Conor** — Venture Institute, NYC VC network access
- **Yashodhana** — VC Lab peer, NYC event organizer
```

### Update Financial Reality:

```markdown
- **Day rate (consulting):** $1,500 (NYC market rate)
- **Consulting pipeline:** Near zero — needs building
```

### Add to Other Projects:

```markdown
4. **DepoDigest**
   - Legal AI platform for US law firms
   - NYC market focus
   - Related to Legal AI expertise (RAG, <0.2% hallucination)
   - Status: Early stage, needs project brief
```

## 17. Files That Couldn't Be Read (iCloud Sync Issues)

These files returned "Resource deadlock avoided" or "Unknown system error -11":
- `10-Projects/CNC-Planner-Feedback.md` (2.5KB — has content!)
- `10-Projects/Maschinenbau-Schlottwitz/proposal-draft.md`
- `10-Projects/Maschinenbau-Schlottwitz/regional-leads.md`
- `10-Projects/Content-Engine/Blog-Drafts/blog-compound-ai-stack.md`
- `10-Projects/Content-Engine/Blog-Drafts/post-microsoft-concentration-risk.md`
- `10-Projects/Content-Engine/Blog-Drafts/post-specialist-ai-wins.md`
- `10-Projects/VC-Career/README.md`
- `10-Projects/VC-Career/00-Job-Search-Strategy.md`
- `10-Projects/VC-Career/Fund-Research/_Index.md`
- `20-Knowledge/VC-Intelligence/Insights/AI-Scaffolding-Shift.md`

- `20-Knowledge/People/Monique-Barbanson.md`
- `20-Knowledge/AI/Paper-Clustering-Pipeline.md`
- `00-Inbox/KANBAN.md`

**Recommendation:** Force iCloud sync or read these files when connectivity is better. CNC-Planner-Feedback.md (2.5KB) likely has post-demo feedback that's critical for sales.
