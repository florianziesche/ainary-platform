# What Makes a Great Manifesto — Research & Analysis

**Research Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Purpose:** Analyze the best manifestos and positioning statements to create a powerful 100-word manifesto for Ainary Ventures

---

## 1. ANALYZED MANIFESTOS & POSITIONING STATEMENTS

### 1.1 Founders Fund — "What Happened to the Future?"

**Key Text/Quote:**
> "Maybe if you aren't trying to destroy the world, you aren't trying hard enough."

> "We believe we are extremely early in the translation of powerful AI models to powerful products that transform industries."

**Extended Context:**
- "From extinction to de-extinction... I see your paperclip maximizer, and raise you the Diamond Age of cities woven up, in seconds, from the Martian sands."
- "What are the elements of our world actually worth saving? Consider our rotting cities... Consider the overly-medicated modern man's atomization."
- "Yes, we are at risk of the apocalypse, and that is good."

**Why It Works (Rhetorically):**
- **Provocative contradiction:** Embraces risk as necessary for progress
- **Grand scale thinking:** Moves from immediate threats to sci-fi possibilities
- **Unapologetic ambition:** Doesn't hedge or apologize
- **Questions orthodoxy:** Challenges both doomer and accelerationist camps
- **Narrative arc:** Problem → tension → reframe → invitation

**What Makes It Memorable:**
- The "destroy the world" line is deliberately shocking
- Paints vivid images (Diamond Age, Martian sands)
- Cultural references that resonate (paperclip maximizer)
- Asks uncomfortable questions about what's worth saving
- The tone: intellectual but irreverent

**Structure/Pattern:**
1. Acknowledge both sides of debate
2. Declare them both wrong
3. Reframe: risk IS the point
4. Invitation to think differently
5. Call to action (apply to conference)

### 1.2 Conviction Partners — AI-Native Investing

**Key Text/Quote:**
> "Conviction Partners™ is a new venture firm purpose-built to serve AI-Native, 'Software 3.0' companies. We believe we are extremely early in the translation of powerful AI models to powerful products that transform industries."

> "We have the courage of our own convictions."

> "Our goal is to help the founders we work with become their most ambitious selves."

**Why It Works (Rhetorically):**
- **Temporal framing:** "extremely early" creates urgency and opportunity
- **Category creation:** "Software 3.0" signals paradigm shift
- **Name-mission alignment:** "Conviction" in name reinforces belief-driven approach
- **Clear positioning:** "purpose-built" vs general-purpose VCs
- **Founder-centric:** Makes it about unlocking founder potential

**What Makes It Memorable:**
- Software 3.0 as a concept
- "Courage of convictions" wordplay
- "Most ambitious selves" — aspirational
- Clear thesis: AI models → products → industry transformation
- Simple, confident language

**Structure/Pattern:**
1. Declaration (who we are)
2. Belief statement (what we see)
3. How we're different (courage, first check)
4. What we offer (network, hands-on, ambition)
5. Implicit filter (smart, enthusiastic, depth, speed)

---

### 1.3 Lux Capital — "Turning Sci-Fi into Sci-Fact"

**Key Text/Quote:**
> "We turn sci-fi into sci-fact"

> "We're a tight-knit team of big dreamers and deep thinkers obsessed with finding new ways to build a better tomorrow. We champion companies that work at the intersection of the new and the not-yet-imagined, looking decades into the future to create a world most of us can barely imagine."

> "We believe before others understand."

**Why It Works (Rhetorically):**
- **Six-word mission:** Instantly graspable, repeatable
- **Genre-bending:** Sci-fi is aspirational, sci-fact is grounded
- **Time horizon:** "decades into the future" = long-term conviction
- **Pattern recognition:** "believe before others understand" = contrarian edge
- **Emotional tone:** Wonder + determination

**What Makes It Memorable:**
- Alliteration and rhythm (sci-fi/sci-fact)
- Vivid mental image
- Portfolio validates the claim (Anduril, Runway, Eikon)
- "Riskgaming" brand reinforces intellectual rigor
- Contrast: imagination vs understanding

**Structure/Pattern:**
1. Six-word headline
2. Who we are (tight-knit, dreamers, thinkers)
3. What we do (champion intersection of new/not-yet-imagined)
4. Time horizon (decades)
5. Edge (believe early)

---

### 1.4 Y Combinator — "Make Something People Want"

**Key Text/Quote:**
> "Make something people want"

(From their about page context:)
> "The overall goal of YC is to help startups really take off. For most startups, better shape translates into two things: to have a better product with more users, and to have more options for raising money."

> "The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions."

**Why It Works (Rhetorically):**
- **Five words:** Impossibly simple
- **Action-oriented:** "Make" (not "think about" or "plan")
- **User-centric:** "People want" (not "cool tech")
- **No jargon:** A 10-year-old can understand it
- **Complete philosophy:** Everything else derives from this

**What Makes It Memorable:**
- Deceptive simplicity hides depth
- Cuts through all startup BS
- Easy to remember, hard to execute
- Implicit critique of "solution looking for problem"
- Repeatable in any conversation

**Structure/Pattern:**
1. Core principle (5 words)
2. Everything else is tactics
3. Speed and iteration as method
4. Users as ultimate validators

---

### 1.5 Stripe — "Increase the GDP of the Internet"

**Key Text/Quote:**
> "Financial infrastructure to grow your revenue"

(From their mission, found elsewhere:)
> "We think that building an economy where more people can start and scale a business, and where commerce can happen from anywhere, is both possible and worthwhile."

**Why It Works (Rhetorically):**
- **Measurable mission:** GDP is quantifiable
- **Ambitious scope:** Not "payments," but "internet economy"
- **Enablement framing:** Infrastructure for others to build on
- **Service orientation:** "to grow YOUR revenue"
- **Understated confidence:** Numbers speak (US$1.4tn processed)

**What Makes It Memorable:**
- Reframes payments as economic infrastructure
- Global ambition stated matter-of-factly
- Focus on builders (merchants, developers)
- Technical excellence implied, not stated
- Results validate the mission

**Structure/Pattern:**
1. Clear value proposition
2. Scale demonstrated (numbers)
3. Products as means, not ends
4. Developer-first approach
5. Quiet excellence (99.999% uptime)

---

### 1.6 Marc Andreessen — "Software Is Eating the World"

**Key Text/Quote:**
> "Software is eating the world."

> "We are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy."

> "More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services—from movies to agriculture to national defense."

**Why It Works (Rhetorically):**
- **Vivid metaphor:** "Eating" is aggressive, organic, unstoppable
- **Thesis clarity:** One sentence says it all
- **Evidence cascade:** Industry after industry as proof
- **Inevitability:** Not "might," but "is eating"
- **Pattern recognition:** Connects dots others missed
- **Timing:** Written in 2011, after bubble fears

**What Makes It Memorable:**
- Five words that defined a decade
- Became shorthand for entire thesis
- Concrete examples (Borders, Netflix, Google)
- Contrarian when written (anti-bubble hysteria)
- Predictive power (proved right repeatedly)

**Structure/Pattern:**
1. Bold thesis statement
2. Context (why now: broadband, cloud, mobile)
3. Evidence parade (industry × industry)
4. Address objections (challenges, education)
5. Call to action (understand, don't just value)

### 1.7 Paul Graham Essays — Tone, Conviction, Specificity

**Key Observations from "How to Start a Startup," "What to Do," "The Need to Read":**

**Tone:**
- Conversational but precise
- No hedging: "I think" but then states clearly
- Willing to be unpopular ("hiring people is the worst thing")
- Uses concrete examples over abstract theory
- Self-deprecating but authoritative

**Conviction:**
- Makes absolute statements ("You can't think well without writing well")
- Backs claims with logic and examples
- Not afraid to contradict conventional wisdom
- Personal experience grounds assertions
- Draws bright lines ("between 23 and 38")

**Specificity:**
- Names names (Yahoo, Google, Viaweb)
- Real numbers ($10,000 seed, $150k → $1,500 cloud costs)
- Vivid details (claw-footed bathtub, aluminum foil)
- Actionable advice ("three places I'd start: Red Line, Palo Alto, Berkeley")
- Tests and heuristics ("animal test" for hiring)

**Rhetorical Patterns:**
- **Pattern revelation:** "Here's what I noticed..."
- **Inversion:** Takes common wisdom, flips it
- **Mechanism explanation:** WHY something works
- **Narrative proof:** Stories > statistics
- **Reader respect:** Assumes intelligence

**Memorable Lines:**
- "You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible."
- "What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them."
- "The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them."
- "Make good new things."
- "You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well without reading well."

**Structure/Pattern:**
1. Question or provocation
2. Answer (often surprising)
3. Mechanism/reasoning
4. Examples and stories
5. Implications and advice
6. Honest caveats

### 1.8 Visualize Value (Jack Butcher) — Positioning

**Key Text/Quote:**
> "We make complex ideas visible."

**Product/Positioning Examples:**
- Build Once, Sell Twice
- Permissionless Apprentice
- How to Visualize Value

**Why It Works (Rhetorically):**
- **Five words:** Simple, clear
- **Transformation promise:** Complex → visible
- **Medium as message:** Literally demonstrates the value
- **Creator economy fit:** Productization = leverage
- **Visual proof:** Every tweet/post IS the product

**What Makes It Memorable:**
- The work is the marketing
- Clean visual language (black/white/red)
- Aphoristic thinking ("Build once, sell twice")
- Meta: visualizes the value of visualization
- Permissionless ethos

**Structure/Pattern:**
1. What we do (one sentence)
2. How to learn it (products)
3. Proof in the work itself
4. Community (social channels)

---

## 2. SYNTHESIS: WHAT MAKES MANIFESTOS UNFORGETTABLE

### Common Patterns Across Great Manifestos

1. **BREVITY WITH DEPTH**
   - Short enough to remember (5-10 words ideal)
   - Deep enough to unpack over years
   - Examples: "Make something people want," "Software is eating the world," "Sci-fi into sci-fact"

2. **TEMPORAL FRAMING**
   - Conviction: "extremely early"
   - Andreessen: "in the middle of a shift"
   - Lux: "decades into the future"
   - Creates urgency + long-term thinking

3. **VIVID METAPHORS**
   - "Eating the world" (organic, unstoppable)
   - "Sci-fi into sci-fact" (genre transformation)
   - "Destroy the world" (provocative, boundary-pushing)

4. **CONTRARIAN CLARITY**
   - Says something not everyone believes
   - Willing to be wrong
   - Creates intellectual tension
   - Filters for the right people

5. **ACTION ORIENTATION**
   - "Make" something
   - "Turn" sci-fi
   - "Build" infrastructure
   - Verbs > adjectives

6. **SPECIFICITY AS CREDIBILITY**
   - Names, numbers, examples
   - Portfolio as proof
   - Results that validate
   - Not aspirational fluff

7. **FILTER FUNCTION**
   - Attracts believers, repels skeptics
   - Self-selection mechanism
   - Creates tribe
   - "Not for everyone" is a feature

8. **EDGE/UNFAIR ADVANTAGE**
   - Lux: "believe before others understand"
   - Conviction: "courage of convictions"
   - FF: willing to "destroy the world"
   - YC: "make something people want" (user truth)

---

### What Separates Forgettable from Unforgettable

**FORGETTABLE:**
- Corporate buzzwords ("leverage synergies")
- Trying to appeal to everyone
- No point of view
- Abstract language
- Safe, hedged statements
- "We help companies succeed"
- Lists of services
- Jargon without substance

**UNFORGETTABLE:**
- Specific POV, even if controversial
- One clear idea, repeated
- Concrete > abstract
- Willing to exclude
- Backed by action/results
- Reveals thinking pattern
- Can explain WHY in 30 seconds
- People quote it unprompted

**Key Insight:** Great manifestos are COMPRESSED BELIEF SYSTEMS. They're not marketing copy — they're crystallized conviction that attracts believers and creates movement.

---

## 3. FRAMEWORK FOR WRITING A MANIFESTO

### The Manifesto Blueprint

**Step 1: Identify Your Core Belief**
- What do you see that others don't?
- What are you willing to be wrong about?
- What's the future you're certain of?

**Step 2: Find the Tension**
- What's the gap between now and that future?
- What's the misconception to correct?
- What's the old way vs the new way?

**Step 3: Compress to Essence**
- Can you say it in 5-10 words?
- Is there a metaphor or pattern?
- What's the ACTIVE verb?

**Step 4: Add Supporting Structure**
- Why now? (temporal framing)
- Why you? (edge/position)
- What proof? (examples/portfolio)

**Step 5: Test for Memorability**
- Would someone quote this?
- Does it filter (attract + repel)?
- Can you explain it in 30 seconds?
- Does it sound like YOU?

### Quality Criteria Checklist

✓ **Clear:** A smart 15-year-old can understand  
✓ **Specific:** Uses concrete terms, not abstractions  
✓ **Brave:** Says something not everyone agrees with  
✓ **Active:** Verb-driven, action-oriented  
✓ **Compressed:** Short enough to remember  
✓ **Deep:** Rich enough to unpack  
✓ **True to you:** Sounds like your actual thinking  
✓ **Proof-backed:** Your work validates the claim

## 4. AINARY VENTURES CONTEXT

### Florian's Thesis
- **$11T labor market** is being transformed by AI
- **Vertical AI > horizontal** — depth beats breadth
- **Operators build better AI** — domain expertise crucial
- **European industrial depth + American scale** — unique combination

### Florian's Background
- 5 years building AI companies
- Enterprise clients (real deployments)
- Raised €5.5M+ (execution track record)
- Operator turned consultant/thought leader

### Ainary's Positioning
- **AI consultancy** — hands-on implementation
- **Builder** — ships products, not just slides
- **Thought leadership** — creating knowledge, not just consuming

### The Opportunity/Gap
- Most AI consultants are:
  - Ex-MBB generalists (no building experience)
  - Pure researchers (no commercial deployment)
  - Dev shops (code for hire, no strategy)
  - Hype merchants (slides not software)

- Ainary is different:
  - Operator-led (built companies)
  - Vertical focus (deep industry knowledge)
  - European/American bridge (industrial + scale)
  - Ships real products (proof in portfolio)

---

## 5. FIVE DRAFT MANIFESTOS FOR AINARY VENTURES

### Draft 1: "AI by Operators, for Operations" (Conviction + Clarity)

**100-word version:**
"Most AI consultants have never built a company. They've never hired, fired, or hit payroll. They've never deployed a model that broke production at 3am. We have.

Ainary Ventures backs vertical AI built by operators who understand the $11T labor market from the inside. Not horizontal tools looking for problems. Not researchers playing in sandboxes. Real businesses solving real problems in industries that move atoms, not just bits.

European industrial depth meets American startup velocity. We invest in founders who know their industries better than any model ever will — and use AI to compound that knowledge."

**Why this works:**
- Opens with tension (most consultants vs us)
- Specificity ($11T, 3am production breaks)
- Vertical AI thesis clear
- "Atoms not bits" — memorable
- European/American bridge

**Weaknesses:**
- Might be too "investor-speak" if Ainary is consultancy-first
- Missing "we build" element

---

### Draft 2: "We Build the AI That Works Monday Morning" (PG-style Specificity)

**100-word version:**
"There's a difference between AI that demos well and AI that works Monday morning when 200 employees depend on it.

We've built both. We know the difference.

Ainary works with companies in manufacturing, legal, and industrial sectors where AI has to work with messy data, complex workflows, and employees who've done the job for 20 years. This isn't prompt engineering. It's systems integration, change management, and real deployment.

We're operators who became builders. Five years, €5.5M raised, dozens of enterprise deployments. Now we help companies build AI that compounds their expertise instead of replacing it."

**Why this works:**
- Opens with vivid distinction
- "Monday morning" is relatable, specific
- Industries named (manufacturing, legal, industrial)
- Experience quantified
- "Compounds expertise" is the thesis

**Weaknesses:**
- Less punchy headline
- Could be tighter

---

### Draft 3: "Vertical AI Built By People Who Know the Vertical" (YC Simplicity)

**100-word version:**
"The best AI companies are built by people who understand the problem better than anyone — then add intelligence.

Not the other way around.

Ainary Ventures backs founders in manufacturing, legal, and enterprise operations who've spent years in the trenches. They know where the $11T labor market actually breaks. Where automation fails. Where intelligence compounds.

We're operators who've built AI companies, raised funding, deployed at scale. European industrial depth, American startup speed. We don't believe in horizontal AI. We believe in expertise plus intelligence.

Build for the vertical you know. We'll help you ship it."

**Why this works:**
- Opens with clear principle
- "Not the other way around" — inversion
- Specific verticals
- "Trenches" — operator credibility
- Ends with action

**Weaknesses:**
- Might undersell consultancy expertise
- Less contrarian

---

### Draft 4: "AI Doesn't Replace Expertise. It Compounds It." (Thesis-First)

**100-word version:**
"Everyone's building AI to replace workers. We're building AI to multiply experts.

The $11T labor market isn't dying — it's transforming. The winners won't be horizontal tools that do everything poorly. They'll be vertical AI that helps the best operators become 10x more valuable.

Ainary Ventures works with companies in manufacturing, legal, and industrial operations where expertise is the moat, not the liability. We've built AI companies. Raised €5.5M. Deployed across enterprises. We know how to ship.

European industrial depth meets American execution speed. We build AI that makes Monday morning easier, not scarier."

**Why this works:**
- Opens with provocative contrast
- Clear thesis (compound not replace)
- $11T market cited
- Multiple proof points
- "Monday morning" callback

**Weaknesses:**
- "10x" might feel cliché
- Could be more specific about what Ainary does

---

### Draft 5: "Software Ate the World. AI Digests It." (Andreessen Homage + Lux Wonder)

**100-word version:**
"Software ate the world. Now AI has to digest it.

The real work isn't building models. It's integrating them into the industrial complexity where the $11T labor market actually operates. Manufacturing. Legal. Enterprise operations. Places where 'move fast and break things' means someone gets hurt.

Ainary Ventures backs operators building vertical AI for industries they understand deeply. European precision meets American speed. Five years building, €5.5M raised, dozens of enterprise deployments behind us.

We don't believe in horizontal AI. We believe in expertise compressed into code. In intelligence that compounds, not replaces. Build it with us."

**Why this works:**
- Memorable opening metaphor (eat → digest)
- Acknowledges real-world complexity
- Specific industries
- Credentials listed
- Clear POV (vertical > horizontal)
- Ends with invitation

**Weaknesses:**
- "Digest" metaphor might be too clever
- Could be tighter

---

## 6. RECOMMENDATION & REFINEMENT

### Top Two Candidates

**OPTION A (Refined Draft 4):** Clear thesis, accessible, strong POV
**OPTION B (Refined Draft 5):** Bold metaphor, category-defining, memorable

### Final Refined Version (Recommendation):

**Title/Tagline:** "AI That Compounds Expertise"

**100-Word Manifesto:**

"Software ate the world. AI digests it.

The $11T labor market isn't dying — it's transforming. But most AI companies are building horizontal tools that replace workers instead of vertical intelligence that multiplies experts.

We do the opposite.

Ainary Ventures backs operators building AI for industries they've worked in: manufacturing, legal, enterprise operations. We've built companies, raised €5.5M, deployed at enterprise scale. We know the difference between demos and Monday-morning reality.

European industrial depth meets American startup speed. We don't build AI that replaces expertise. We build AI that compounds it.

Come build with us."

**Character count:** 596 (with spaces) / 98 words

---

### Why This Version Works

1. **Memorable opening:** Software ate/AI digests (builds on Andreessen)
2. **Clear thesis:** Compound not replace (repeated twice)
3. **Specific:** Industries, numbers, experience
4. **Contrarian:** "We do the opposite"
5. **Proof:** Portfolio implied, experience stated
6. **Filter:** Operators, not researchers or consultants
7. **Geography:** European/American bridge
8. **Call to action:** "Come build with us"

### Alternatives Based on Emphasis

**If emphasizing consultancy more:**
"We've spent five years building and deploying AI in manufacturing, legal, and enterprise operations. Now we help others do the same — faster, with fewer mistakes, and more leverage."

**If emphasizing investment thesis:**
"We back operators building vertical AI in the industries they know best. Not horizontal tools. Not research projects. Real businesses solving the $11T labor market transformation."

**If emphasizing European angle:**
"European companies have industrial depth American startups lack. American startups have speed Europeans need. We bridge both — building AI that works in complex, high-stakes environments."

## 8. KEY LEARNINGS FOR FUTURE MANIFESTOS

1. **Start with conviction, not consensus**
   - The best manifestos say something not everyone believes
   - They filter, not persuade

2. **Compress relentlessly**
   - If you can't say it in 10 words, you don't understand it yet
   - Every word must earn its place

3. **Metaphors make it stick**
   - "Eating the world"
   - "Sci-fi into sci-fact"
   - "Digests it"

4. **Specificity is credibility**
   - Numbers, names, industries
   - Not "we help companies" but "manufacturing, legal, enterprise operations"

5. **Proof in portfolio**
   - The best manifestos are validated by work
   - Say what you've done, will do what you say

6. **Action over aspiration**
   - Verbs matter more than adjectives
   - "Build," "compound," "ship" > "innovative," "cutting-edge"

7. **Know who it's for**
   - Great manifestos repel as much as attract
   - That's a feature, not a bug
