## 🔥 Breakthrough (9/10)

### 1. Owning the AI Pareto Frontier — Jeff Dean
- **Source:** Latent Space (Podcast)
- **Link:** https://www.latent.space/p/jeffdean
- **Published:** 2026-02-12
- **Relevance:** 9/10
- **Summary:** Google's Chief AI Scientist on multi-agent architecture, distillation as the engine behind Flash models, trillion-token attention systems, and why energy (picojoules) not FLOPs is the new bottleneck. Discusses evolution from sharded indices to multimodal reasoning systems.
- **Keywords:** Multi-agent, architecture, distillation, scaling, Gemini, TPUs, sparse models

## High Relevance (7-8/10)

### 2. Introducing GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark
- **Source:** Simon Willison
- **Link:** https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/12/codex-spark/
- **Published:** 2026-02-12
- **Relevance:** 7/10
- **Summary:** OpenAI × Cerebras launch ultra-fast coding model at 1,000 tokens/second. Smaller than GPT-5.3-Codex (128k context, text-only), optimized for real-time coding iteration and flow state. Speed enables more productive agent-human collaboration.
