- **Notes:** HIGHEST PRIORITY. Their "AI eats software" thesis directly maps to Florian's experience at 36ZERO. The growth fund needs operating partners who can help portfolio companies scale. Toronto HQ but expanding globally.

### 2. Air Street Capital 🇬🇧
- **Website:** https://www.airstreet.com
- **AUM:** ~$17M (solo GP fund)

- **Fit Score: 3/5** — Solo GP, no hiring. But great network connection for deal flow.
- **Notes:** Too small for a role, but Nathan is extremely well-connected in AI VC. Worth connecting for network purposes. State of AI Report is influential — Florian's Agent Trust research could be cited/featured.
