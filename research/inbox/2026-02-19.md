## Top Articles

### 1. The Reasonable Effectiveness of Virtue Ethics in AI Alignment
**Source:** The Gradient  
**Link:** https://thegradient.pub/virtue-ethics-ai-alignment/  
**Relevance:** 8/10 — AI agent architecture, alignment theory  
**Summary:** Argues rational AI agents shouldn't have "goals" but "practices" — networks of actions/dispositions/evaluations that self-promote. Proposes "eudaimonic rationality" (act excellently to promote excellence) vs consequentialist optimization. Claims this solves alignment paradoxes (corrigibility, harmlessness) more naturally. Dense philosophy but has technical implications for agent design.

**Key concept:** "promote X X-ingly" (art promotes art artistically, kindness kindly). Means/ends collapse into practice.

### 2. SWE-bench February 2026 Leaderboard Update
**Source:** Simon Willison  
**Link:** https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/19/swe-bench/  
**Relevance:** 7/10 — AI coding agent benchmarks  
**Summary:** Fresh benchmark run across current models using mini-swe-bench agent (9K lines Python). Claude Opus 4.5 leads at ~68%, beats Opus 4.6 by 1pt. Gemini 3 Flash #2, MiniMax M2.5 (229B Chinese model) #3. GPT-5.2 at #6. Bash-only setup, 2,294 real-world coding problems from Django/Sympy/scikit-learn/etc.

**Note:** Same system prompt for all = fair comparison but not optimized per-model.

### 3. Typing Without Having to Type
**Source:** Simon Willison  
**Link:** https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/18/typing/  
**Relevance:** 6/10 — Meta observation on coding agents  
**Summary:** After 25+ years resisting type hints (slowed iteration/REPL), Simon now favors them because coding agents do the typing. Benefits (clarity, safety) outweigh cost when cost → 0.

**Insight:** Agent economics change developer preferences. What's verbose for humans is free for agents.
