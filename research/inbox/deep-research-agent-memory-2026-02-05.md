### Key Takeaways
1. Memory is the moat
2. Document in files, not "in memory"
3. Zettelkasten for agent knowledge
4. Self-improvement requires curation
5. Architecture depends on task
6. Human-AI collab still primitive
7. Context engineering > prompt engineering
8. The Compound Knowledge Thesis: documentation compounds
