## Template 1: Former Colleague/Founder Friend

**Subject:** Quick question + catching up

---

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! It's been a while since [context — last time you talked/met].

I'm reaching out because I've been doing some interesting AI consulting work lately — helping founders implement AI systems that actually compound (not just ChatGPT wrappers).

Given what you're building at [Company], I thought you might find it relevant. 

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to catch up? No pitch, just curious what you're working on and if there's any way I can help.

Best,
Florian

## Template 2: LinkedIn Connection (Warm)

**Subject:** AI systems for [their company/industry]

---

Hi [Name],

We connected a while back on LinkedIn — I've been following what you're building at [Company] and it's impressive.

I'm reaching out because I've been helping founders implement compound AI systems — think persistent memory, automated workflows, AI agents that actually work in production.

Based on [specific thing about their company], I think there might be some quick wins I could help with.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore? No pressure — happy to share ideas even if there's no fit.

Best,
Florian

## Template 3: Investor/Advisor Introduction

**Subject:** AI implementation help for portfolio companies

---

Hi [Name],

I hope this finds you well. We [met at X / were introduced by Y / connected on LinkedIn].

I'm reaching out because I've been doing AI consulting for founders — specifically helping them implement production AI systems (RAG, agents, automation) that compound over time.

I thought this might be relevant for your portfolio companies. If any of them are:
- Struggling to go from AI prototype to production
- Wanting to implement AI but not sure where to start
- Building AI products and need technical guidance

I'd be happy to chat with them. I've done this for enterprise AI (BMW, Siemens, Bosch) and now help earlier-stage companies.

Would you be open to making an intro if there's a fit?

Best,
Florian

## Template 4: Past Client Referral Request

**Subject:** Quick favor?

---

Hey [Name],

Hope all is well with you and [Company]! 

I'm expanding my AI consulting practice and looking for founders who need help implementing AI systems — similar to what we worked on together.

Do you know anyone who might benefit? Specifically looking for:
- Founders building AI products
- Companies wanting to implement AI workflows
- Anyone struggling with AI in production

If anyone comes to mind, I'd really appreciate an intro. And of course, happy to return the favor.

Thanks!
Florian

## Template 5: Cold Outreach (Targeted)

**Subject:** Saw your post about [AI challenge] — can help

---

I saw your recent [post/comment/tweet] about [specific AI challenge they mentioned]. I've solved that exact problem before.

Specifically for [their challenge], I've found that [one insight or approach].
