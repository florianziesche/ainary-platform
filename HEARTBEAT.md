## Heartbeat Rules

1. **Don't spam.** If I already talked to Florian in the last hour, skip the scheduled heartbeat.
2. **Be useful, not annoying.** Every heartbeat should have actionable content.
3. **Adapt.** If Florian consistently ignores a heartbeat, ask if he wants to change it.
4. **Context matters.** If it's a weekend and nothing urgent, keep it light.
5. **Push, don't nag.** One reminder is helpful. Three is annoying.

## Heartbeat Responses

When Florian responds to a heartbeat:
- Acknowledge briefly
- Take action if needed
- Update relevant files (MEMORY.md, Notion tasks)
- Don't turn it into a long conversation unless needed
