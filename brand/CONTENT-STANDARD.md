## 1. Brand Voice — Who Is Speaking?

### Identity
**Finite Matter** = Applied AI for Business Builders
- Not academic (Mollick covers that)
- Not tech strategy for investors (Packy covers that)
- Not growth frameworks (Lenny covers that)
- **Our lane: An operator who builds with AI, shares what works and what doesn't, and compounds publicly.**

### Voice Archetype: "The Experienced Friend"
The friend who already did the thing you're thinking about, had it blow up in their face twice, figured it out, and now tells you the short version over coffee.

**We ARE:**
- Direct — shortest path between idea and understanding
- Opinionated — we take positions, don't hedge
- Specific — data points, tool names, actual numbers
- Honest — including about failures, but framed as insight, not confession
- Conversational — like talking to a smart friend, not reading a textbook
- Understated — say less, mean more. The strongest sentence has the fewest words.

**We are NOT:**
- Academic — no citations in the body (footnotes if needed)
- Hyped — no "revolutionary" / "game-changing" / "transformative"
- Self-deprecating — failures are learning, not identity
- Preachy — no "you should" without showing "I did"
- Neutral — we always have a take
- Overwritten — if a paragraph works in 2 sentences, don't use 4

### The 4 Voice Dimensions (from 36ZERO Guidelines adapted)

| Dimension | We Are | We Are NOT |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Tone** | Confident, calm | Aggressive, arrogant |
| **Formality** | Smart-casual (jeans + blazer) | Academic OR bro-culture |
| **Emotion** | Measured honesty | Vulnerability porn OR hype |
| **Complexity** | Simple language, complex ideas | Jargon OR dumbed-down |

### Florian's Natural Voice (from LinkedIn data)

Analyzed from the post that got 10K+ impressions and 47 likes:
- 2-4 sentences per thought
- One strong opinion per paragraph
- One data point maximum
- Zero flattery, zero hedging
- Strongest sentence LAST (builds up, doesn't start with the punchline)
- No "I think" or "probably" — just states it
- Personal stories as evidence, not as emotional hooks

---

## 2. Tone of Voice — The Spectrum

### Substack Articles (Long-form, 1,500-2,500 words)
**Tone: 70% Authority, 30% Vulnerability**

- Write like you're briefing a friend who has 10 minutes
- Open with a fact or scene, never with a question
- Share what happened, then what you learned
- Vulnerability = showing the gap between expectation and reality (insight)
- NOT vulnerability = "I'm a mess" / "I suck at this" (confession)

### LinkedIn Posts (Short-form, 100-250 words)
**Tone: 80% Authority, 20% Curiosity**

- One idea. One take. That's the post.
- First line breaks the scroll (number, bold claim, or counterintuitive statement)
- Last line is the strongest (not a question — a statement)
- CTA only if natural

### Substack Notes (Micro, 50-150 words)
**Tone: 90% Observation, 10% Provocation**

- Quick takes, unfinished thoughts, behind-the-scenes
- Conversation starters, not lectures
- Engage others' Notes more than you post your own (10:3 ratio)

---

## 3. Article Anatomy — The Finite Matter Formula

Based on analysis of top performers (Mollick, Packy, Welsh, Bloom):

### 3.1 Title
**Format:** `[Action/Promise]. [Qualifier/Honest Context].`
- "I Replaced My Back Office With AI Agents. Here's What Actually Works."
- "Why 2026 Is the Year of the One-Person Company."

**Rules:**
- Max 12 words (ideally 8-10)
- Must pass the "Would I click this in a feed?" test
- Avoid: "How to" (overused), questions (weak), clickbait without payoff
- Pattern that works: **Personal action + honest framing** ("Here's what actually...")

### 3.2 Subtitle
One sentence that tells the reader: "This is for you. You'll get this value."
- "An operator's honest report — what works, what fails, and what nobody tells you."
- Subtitle = the promise. Article = delivery on that promise.

### 3.3 The Hook (First 3 lines)
**This is where you win or lose.** 60% of readers decide in the first 3 lines.

**What works (from research):**

| Hook Type | Example | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Scene/Fact** | "Last night, 12 AI agents worked while I slept." | Strong opening, creates curiosity |
| **Counterintuitive** | "The AI didn't fail me. I failed me." | Contrarian takes |
| **Number + Surprise** | "50 deliverables. $10. One night." | Data-driven pieces |
| **Story Entry** | "When I founded my startup five years ago..." | Personal narrative |

**What doesn't work:**
- Starting with a question ("Have you ever...?") — weak, overused
- Starting with a definition ("AI agents are...") — boring, academic
- Starting with "I" without a scene — no context, no pull
- Starting with a quote — feels borrowed, not owned

### 3.4 Context Bridge (After hook, before meat)
2-3 sentences that tell the reader WHY they should care NOW.
- What happened that triggered this piece?
- What's the background the reader needs?
- Transition from "interesting" to "useful"

### 3.5 The Meat (70% of the article)
**Packy McCormick structure** (proven at 256K subs):
- Digestible chunks: subheadings every 200-300 words
- After every dense paragraph: a story, a metaphor, or a breath
- Reader should never feel lost — if they skip a section, the next one still makes sense
- **Bold the key phrase** in each section (1 bold per 200 words max)

**Ethan Mollick structure** (proven at 392K subs):
- Research-backed but not academic
- "Here's what I found" > "Studies show that"
- Always includes "what this means for you"
- Clear, lucid, never overwrites

**Justin Welsh structure** (proven at $12M revenue):
- VFA: Visceral opener → Fresh perspective → Anaphora (repetition for impact)
- "Trailer → Meat → Summary + CTC (Call to Conversation)"
- Every line earns the next line

### 3.6 The Turn (The "But")
Every great article has a moment where the narrative shifts.
- "That's the story. Now here's the truth."
- "What actually works" → "What doesn't" → "Why that matters"
- The Turn creates the tension that makes the piece memorable.

### 3.7 The Takeaway
1-3 concrete things the reader can DO after reading.
- Not abstract ("think about AI differently")
- Concrete ("Start with one agent. Research your next customer meeting. Define the output before you start.")

### 3.8 The Close
**Strongest line of the article goes here.**

| Close Type | Example | When |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **Authority statement** | "That's not a technical problem. It's a leadership one." | After insight-driven pieces |
| **Reframe** | "The question isn't whether AI can. It's whether you will." | After setup/structure pieces |
| **Callback** | Return to the opening scene with new meaning | After narrative pieces |
| **Challenge** | "The AI did the work. Your job is to deliver it." | After action-oriented pieces |

**Never close with:**
- A question alone (weak ending)
- "What do you think?" (gives away authority)
- Summary of what you already said (redundant)
- Multiple CTAs (confusing)

### 3.9 CTA (After the close)
Separated from the article by a divider. Two elements:
1. **Soft sell:** "I'm writing a playbook on [X]. Subscribe to get it."
2. **Engagement prompt:** One specific question that invites reply.

---

## 4. Formatting Rules

### Text
- **Paragraphs:** Max 3-4 lines, then whitespace
- **Subheadings:** H2 every 200-300 words (H3 for sub-sections)
- **Bold:** 1 key phrase per 200 words. Never bold entire sentences.
- **Italics:** For titles, foreign words, or emphasis on a single word
- **Lists:** Bullet points for 3+ items. No numbered lists unless order matters.
- **Dividers:** `---` between major sections

### Structure
- **Total length:** 1,500-2,500 words (sweet spot)
  - Under 1,200 = thin, not enough value
  - Over 3,000 = reader fatigue (unless deep dive)
- **Section count:** 5-7 major sections
- **Image count:** 2-4 max (each must add value, not decorate)

### Mobile
- 60%+ read on phone
- Test every article on mobile before publishing
- No wide tables (break on mobile)
- Images must be legible at phone width

## 5. What Goes Viral (Research-backed)

### Content Types That Spread

| Type | Shareability | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Counterintuitive insight** | ★★★★★ | "AI makes your bottleneck worse, not better" |
| **Personal data + universal truth** | ★★★★★ | "50 deliverables. 6 shipped. The gap is the story." |
| **Framework/playbook** | ★★★★☆ | "The 5-step compound loop" |
| **Behind-the-scenes + honesty** | ★★★★☆ | "Here's my actual org chart with AI agents" |
| **Contrarian take on hype** | ★★★★☆ | "Stop building AI agents. Start directing them." |
| **Pure how-to** | ★★★☆☆ | "How I set up my AI stack" |
| **Listicle** | ★★☆☆☆ | "10 AI tools I use" (low differentiation) |

### What Drives Shares
From Packy McCormick / Welsh / Bloom research:
1. **"I feel seen"** — Reader recognizes their own experience
2. **"I look smart sharing this"** — Reader gains status by resharing
3. **"I couldn't have said this"** — Articulates something the reader felt but couldn't express
4. **"This is useful"** — Concrete enough to act on

### What Doesn't Spread
- "Dear diary" posts (no one shares your feelings)
- Generic advice ("work hard, be consistent")
- Purely technical content (share ceiling = your niche)
- Anything that makes the READER feel bad about themselves

### Structural Tells

- Every paragraph starting with the same pattern
- Perfectly balanced pros/cons (real life isn't balanced)
- "In conclusion" / "To summarize" (trust the reader)

---

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|

## 9. Competitive Positioning — What We Do Differently

| Competitor | Their Lane | Our Lane |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Ethan Mollick | AI research for academics | AI operations for builders |
| Packy McCormick | Tech strategy for investors | AI implementation for operators |
| Lenny Rachitsky | Product management frameworks | AI-augmented entrepreneurship |
| Sahil Bloom | Life frameworks for professionals | Specific AI playbooks for founders |
| Justin Welsh | Creator economy for solopreneurs | AI compound systems for businesses |

**Our unique angle:**
- We SHOW the system, not just talk about it
- Real numbers, real tools, real failures
- Operator perspective (built company, raised $5M, shipped product)
- Cross-domain: AI + VC + Manufacturing + Content (rare combo)
- The "memory moat" / compound knowledge thesis is OURS

---

## 10. Content-to-Revenue Funnel

```
LinkedIn Post (daily, 100-250 words)
  → "More in my newsletter" (link in first comment)
    → Substack Article (weekly, 1,500-2,500 words)
      → Lead Magnet CTA ("AI Agent Playbook" — free PDF)
        → Email Nurture (automated 3-email sequence)
          → Discovery Workshop (€5,000-7,500)
            → Prototype Project (€15,000-25,000)
```

Every article must serve this funnel. Not every article needs a hard sell — but every article must build authority that makes the next step natural.

## 11. SEO & Keyword Strategy

### Warum SEO auf Substack?
Substack-Posts sind öffentliche Webseiten die Google indexiert. Ein gut optimierter Post bringt Monate nach Veröffentlichung noch organische Subscriber — kostenlos.

### Substack SEO-Felder (bei jedem Post setzen!)
1. **Page Title** (SEO Settings) — Keyword-optimiert, kann anders sein als der catchy Headline
   - Headline: "I Replaced My Back Office With AI Agents"
   - Page Title: "How to Run a Business With AI Agents — Setup, Tools, Results"
2. **Meta Description** — 150-160 Zeichen, Keyword enthalten, Value-Proposition klar
3. **URL/Slug** — Kurz, mit Primary Keyword: `/ai-agents-business-setup`
4. **Subtitle** — Keyword hier unterbringen falls nicht im Headline

### Keyword-Strategie für Finite Matter

**Primary Keywords (High Intent, unser Territory):**

| Keyword Cluster | Suchintent | Artikel-Typ |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| AI agents business | How to use AI agents for business | Setup/Playbook |
| AI agent team setup | How to build an AI agent team | Tutorial |
| one person company AI | Solopreneur with AI | Trend/Opinion |
| AI COO / AI back office | Replace back office with AI | Case Study |
| AI productivity solopreneur | Best AI tools for solopreneurs | Listicle |
| compound knowledge system | Build a second brain with AI | Framework |
| agentic AI 2026 | AI agent trends | Trend Report |
| multi-agent orchestration | How multi-agent systems work | Deep Dive |

**Secondary Keywords (Nischen-SEO, weniger Konkurrenz):**
- "AI agent quality gates"
- "AI agent self-improvement"
- "vertical AI manufacturing"
- "AI memory moat"
- "AI agent org chart"
- "founder to VC transition"
- "AI-native operating system"

**Trend-Begriffe 2026 (aus IBM, PwC, Forbes, Salesmate Research):**
- **Agentic AI** — #1 Trend-Term 2025/2026 (IBM: "2026 = year multi-agent systems go to production")
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Rising keyword (Forbes, ML Mastery)
- **AI agent ROI** — Blue Prism: "top discussion for organizations"
- **Autonomous coworkers** — Salesmate trending topic
- **AI governance** — PwC 2026 prediction
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Mollick's "Cyborg" framing
- **AI-native** — Our own positioning term (own it!)

### Keyword-Platzierung pro Artikel

| Wo | Keyword-Regel |
|----|--------------|
| **Headline** | Primary keyword ODER catchy hook (not both) |
| **SEO Page Title** | Primary keyword immer hier |
| **Subtitle** | Keyword wenn nicht im Headline |
| **URL Slug** | Primary keyword, 3-5 Wörter |
| **First 100 words** | Primary keyword natürlich einbauen |
| **H2 Subheadings** | 2-3× Secondary Keywords als H2 |
| **Alt-Text (Images)** | Beschreibend + Keyword |
| **Last paragraph** | Primary keyword nochmal |
| **Meta Description** | Primary keyword + Value Prop |

### Interne Verlinkung
- Jeder neue Artikel verlinkt 1-2 ältere Artikel (Substack intern)
- "Last week I wrote about..." — natürlich, nicht forced
- Baut Domain Authority innerhalb Substack auf

### Externe Verlinkung / Backlinks
- LinkedIn Post → Link in erstem Kommentar → Substack
- Twitter Thread → letzter Tweet = Substack Link
- Jede Erwähnung von OpenClaw, Obsidian, etc. = potentieller Backlink wenn Communitys sharen

### SEO-Checklist (in Post-Settings vor Publish)
- [ ] SEO Page Title gesetzt (keyword-optimiert, ≠ headline)
- [ ] Meta Description geschrieben (150-160 chars)
- [ ] URL Slug angepasst (kurz, keyword)
- [ ] Primary keyword in ersten 100 Wörtern
- [ ] 2-3 H2s enthalten Secondary Keywords
- [ ] 1-2 interne Links zu älteren Posts
- [ ] Preview Email an sich selbst geschickt (Headline + Subtitle check)

---

## 12. Trend-Surfing — Diskurs-Anschluss

### Prinzip
Jeder Artikel sollte an mindestens EINEN aktuellen Diskurs anknüpfen. Nicht um Trends zu jagen, sondern um Sichtbarkeit und Relevanz zu erhöhen.

### Aktuelle Diskurse (Feb 2026)

| Diskurs | Unser Angle | Keywords |
|---------|------------|----------|
| "Year of the Agent" (IBM, Anthropic MCP, Google A2A) | Wir LEBEN es, nicht nur reden | agentic AI, multi-agent, orchestration |
| "AI replacing jobs" Debatte | Reframe: AI replaces tasks, humans direct | AI productivity, human-in-the-loop, cyborg |
| Solopreneur/One-Person Company | Sam Altman's billion-dollar prediction | one person company, solopreneur AI |
| AI ROI skepticism | Wir zeigen echte Zahlen ($10/night, 50 deliverables) | AI agent ROI, AI cost, AI value |
| "AI slop" / Quality concerns | Quality gates, banned words, voice profiles | AI quality, AI-generated content |
| Mollick's "Cyborg" research | Wir sind das Case Study | AI augmentation, Wharton AI study |
| Cursor/Devin/$1B ARR AI tools | Unsere Stack ist anders (orchestration, not coding) | AI tools, AI stack, AI workflow |

### Wie Trends einbauen (ohne cringe)
- **Natürlich referenzieren:** "Ethan Mollick's research found..." (nicht "As AI trends show...")
- **Eigene Daten dagegenstellen:** "They say 40% improvement. Here's what I measured: ..."
- **Kontext geben:** "2026 is being called 'the year of the agent.' Here's what that actually looks like in practice."
- **Nie:** "In today's fast-paced AI landscape..." ❌
