## Application Strategy

1. **Prioritize operator-friendly funds** — don't compete where finance backgrounds win
2. **Reference founder experience prominently** — it's your differentiator
3. **Track like a sales pipeline** — applied → responded → interviewing → offer/reject
4. **Follow up** — 3 days after outreach if no response
