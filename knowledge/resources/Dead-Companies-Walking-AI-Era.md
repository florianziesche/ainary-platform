# Dead Companies Walking ([[AI]] Era)

*Source: [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | 2026-02-01*

---

## The Six Failure Modes

### 1. Learning Only From Recent Past
SaaS multiples have been flat for 3 years. Companies optimizing for 2021 playbooks are already dead.

**Lesson:** The past is not a reliable guide. Look for structural shifts.

---

### 2. Over-Relying on Success Formulas
The sales motions that worked in 2020 don't work now:
- Buyers are more sophisticated
- [[AI]] changes evaluation criteria
- Procurement cycles have shifted

**Lesson:** What got you here won't get you there.

---

### 3. Misreading Customers
> 41% of [[AI]] spend is **net new budget**

This is massive. Companies thinking [[AI]] is just reshuffling existing spend are wrong.

**Lesson:** New budget categories emerge. Position for them.

---

### 4. Falling Victim to Mania
Having an "[[AI]] roadmap" ≠ delivered value.

Customers are learning to distinguish:
- Real [[AI]] capabilities
- Vaporware announcements
- Genuine product improvements

**Lesson:** Ship real value, not press releases.

---

### 5. Failing to Adapt
Obvious but critical. The companies that survive:
- Experiment constantly
- Kill sacred cows
- Move faster than comfortable

**Lesson:** Adaptability > strategy.

---

### 6. Emotional Removal (Leadership)

> "If leadership isn't prompting [[Claude]] daily, they're behind."

Leaders who delegate [[AI]] understanding to their teams are making decisions without context.

**Lesson:** Use the tools yourself. Daily.
