# Microsoft's OpenAI Concentration Risk

*Source: [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | 2026-02-01*

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Microsoft RPO (total) | $625B |
| OpenAI portion | ~$281B |
| Concentration | **45%** |
| Stock reaction | -11% despite beat |

---

## Key Insight

> Even at $3T market cap, customer concentration kills you.

Microsoft beat earnings. Azure grew 39%. 150M monthly Copilot users.

**Still fell 11%.**

Why? Wall Street sees $281B riding on one customer relationship.

## Implications for Startups

### 1. Concentration Risk Scales
If Microsoft can get punished for customer concentration at $625B backlog, you will too at $6M ARR.

### 2. The "Best Customer" Trap
Your biggest customer feels like security. It's actually your biggest risk.

### 3. Diversification Isn't Optional
Rule of thumb: No customer > 20% of revenue.
