# Fundraising Lessons

*Hard-won insights from raising €5.5M+ for 36ZERO Vision.*

---

## Core Insight

> "Write for retrieval, not storage. [[AI]] pulls context from your pages. If your notes are vague, your [[AI]] outputs are vague. Specific detail compounds."

---

## The Compound Knowledge Architecture

Systems beat talent when properly configured. The 100x advantage comes from **feedback loops**:

```
Capture → Connect → Compound → Better Outputs → New Knowledge → Repeat
```

Every tool decision should be evaluated by: **"Does this create or strengthen a feedback loop?"**

## Founder-to-Employee Transition

The struggle to land a [[VC]] role as a former CEO is **normal and common**.

**Why it's hard:**
- Identity mismatch
- Market doesn't know how to read you
- Network was built for different game
- Compensation expectations differ
- Skills gap is real but hard to articulate

**Strategy:**
- Focus on funds that explicitly value operators
- Don't compete where traditional finance backgrounds win
- Patience + targeted strategy over mass applications

---

## Key Patterns

### What Works
- Treat job search like a sales pipeline
- Track: applied → responded → interviewing → offer/reject
- Follow up after 3 days if no response
- Add specific details when complimenting someone's content

### What Doesn't Work
- Mass-applying to all [[VC]] roles
- Generic praise in networking messages
- Competing where you're disadvantaged

## Your Technical Differentiator

Legal [[AI]] RAG architecture achieving <0.2% hallucination:

1. Hybrid retrieval (BM25 sparse + dense semantic)
2. Cross-encoder re-ranking
3. Self-correction loops
4. Multi-agent verification (Questioner → Researcher → Validator → Reporter)
5. Full citation tracking

**Most legal [[AI]] stops at basic RAG. This architecture is production-grade.**

---

## The Expert Archivist Paradigm

Legal [[AI]] should follow a "consultative [[AI]]" approach — prioritizing **veracity and traceability** over generative fluency.

> The system is an expert archivist, not a creative oracle.

All UI/copy should emphasize accuracy and sources, not [[AI]] "intelligence."
