## 🔥 Top Insights This Week

### 1. [[Microsoft-OpenAI-Concentration-Risk]]
**Source:** [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | [Original](https://tomtunguz.com/281b-from-one-customer/)

Microsoft's commercial RPO hit $625B — **45% ($281B) comes from OpenAI alone**. Despite beating earnings, stock fell 11%.

**Key Numbers:**
- Azure grew 39%, constrained by capacity
- 150M monthly active Copilot users
- CapEx: $37.5B/quarter (accelerating)
- Hyperscalers spending ~$150B annually

**Insight:** Even at mega-scale, customer concentration kills you.

### 2. [[AI-Scaffolding-Shift]]
**Source:** [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | [Original](https://tomtunguz.com/the-scaffolding-shift/)

Tool-calling accuracy crossed 90% (up from <50% two years ago).

**What This Means:**
- Frontier models become executives routing to specialists
- Constellation architecture > monoliths
- **New opportunity:** Build specialist agents that executives call first

> "New startup opportunities emerge not from training the largest models, but from training the specialists the executives call first."

### 3. [[Dead-Companies-Walking-AI-Era]]
**Source:** [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | [Original](https://tomtunguz.com/dead-companies-walking/)

Six failure modes in the [[AI]] transition:

1. **Learning only from recent past** — SaaS multiples flat 3 years
2. **Over-relying on success formulas** — Sales motions changed
3. **Misreading customers** — 41% of [[AI]] spend is net new budget
4. **Falling victim to mania** — [[AI]] roadmap ≠ delivered value
5. **Failing to adapt** — Obvious but critical
6. **Emotional removal** — "If leadership isn't prompting [[Claude]] daily, they're behind"

**Related:** [[SaaS-Decline-Thesis]] | [[AI-Budget-Trends]]

### 4. [[RL-Moats-Greylock]]
**Source:** [[Greylock-Partners]] | [Original](https://greylock.com/greymatter/rl-in-real-life-durable-moats/)

RL is overhyped at dinner parties but underutilized in production.

**Key Insight:** 
> "Real moats emerge from symbiotic combination of unique business context, proprietary data, and effective RL approach"

Better foundation models won't solve bespoke problems — that's where startups win.
