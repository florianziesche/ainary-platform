# LP Resources & Networking Guide for Emerging [[VC]] Managers
*Research compiled: February 7, 2026*

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This guide provides actionable resources for emerging [[VC]] managers (Fund I-III) to discover LPs, build networks, and automate deal flow monitoring. Focus areas: LP databases, emerging manager accelerators, NYC networking, and automated monitoring systems.

**Key Insight:** For emerging managers, family offices often close faster than institutional LPs. Most successful Fund I/II raises come from 60-120 highly targeted LPs, not mass outreach to thousands.

---

- **Best For:** Market awareness; pair with a dedicated LP database for outreach

#### **Dealroom**
- **Focus:** European [[VC]] & startup ecosystem mapping
- **Pricing:** ~$12,000+/year
- **Strengths:** Excellent for European tech landscape
- **Weaknesses:** Limited LP/allocator data
- **Website:** https://dealroom.co
- **Best For:** Thematic research on European ecosystems; not for LP discovery

---

**Budget-Conscious (Fund I, <$10M raise):**
- **Core:** Altss (Family Office module) - $10,000/year
- **Free/Low-Cost:** RAISE Emerging Manager Database (see below), Visible.vc Connect, manual research
