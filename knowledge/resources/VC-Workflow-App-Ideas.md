*Last updated: 2026-02-01*
*Status: Initial research — needs X validation*

## 🎯 For VCs / Investors

### Deal Sourcing & Pipeline
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Inbox overload** — 100+ cold pitches/week, hard to triage | [[AI]] pitch screener that scores fit vs thesis | Medium |
| **Missing warm intros** — best deals come via network, hard to track who knows who | Network graph + intro request automation | High |
| **Thesis drift** — hard to stay focused when everything looks interesting | Thesis alignment scorer for every deal | Low |
| **Duplicate outreach** — multiple partners reaching same founder | Shared CRM with collision detection | Low |

### Due Diligence
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Reference checks are manual** — 5-10 calls per deal, all notes scattered | [[AI]]-assisted reference call transcription + synthesis | Medium |
| **Competitive landscape mapping** — manual research takes days | Auto-generate market maps from pitch deck + web | Medium |
| **Financial model review** — founders send broken Excel, hard to validate | Model validator + red flag detector | Medium |
| **Background checks** — Googling founders is tedious | Automated founder profile builder (LinkedIn, news, social) | Low |

### Portfolio Management
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Quarterly updates ignored** — founders send PDFs, no one reads them | Update parser → dashboard + alerts for key metrics | Medium |
| **Follow-on timing** — hard to know when portfolio needs bridge | Runway tracker + proactive alert system | Low |
| **Intro requests from portfolio** — founders constantly need intros | Intro matching engine (portfolio ↔ LP/customer network) | High |

### LP Relations
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Quarterly reports** — painful to compile, often delayed | Auto-generate LP reports from portfolio data | Medium |
| **LP CRM** — relationship tracking with potential/existing LPs | Dedicated LP pipeline tracker | Low |

## 🚀 For Founders / Operators

### Fundraising
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Finding right investors** — spray and pray doesn't work | Investor-founder fit matcher (thesis, stage, check size) | Medium |
| **Tracking investor convos** — who said what, where in process | Fundraise CRM with auto-logging from email | Medium |
| **Pitch deck feedback** — iterations take forever | [[AI]] pitch deck reviewer with specific suggestions | Low |
| **Term sheet comparison** — hard to know if offer is fair | Term sheet analyzer + benchmark data | Medium |

### Hiring
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **First 10 hires** — no HR, no process, just chaos | Lightweight ATS built for seed-stage | Low |
| **Reference checks** — same manual problem as VCs | Automated reference synthesis | Medium |
| **Comp benchmarking** — what should I pay a first engineer? | Real-time comp data for early-stage | Medium |

### Operations
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Board meeting prep** — scrambling every quarter | Board deck generator from metrics + updates | Medium |
| **Investor update writing** — founders procrastinate, updates are late | [[AI]]-assisted monthly update writer | Low |
| **Cap table management** — Excel hell until Series A | Simple cap table for pre-seed/seed | Low |

## 🔧 For Tech Teams

### [[AI]]/ML Engineers
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Prompt versioning** — no git for prompts | Prompt management + A/B testing platform | Medium |
| **Eval pipelines** — hard to measure if prompts improved | Automated eval framework | High |
| **RAG debugging** — "why did it hallucinate?" | RAG debugging/tracing tool | High |
| **Agent orchestration** — building multi-agent systems is messy | Visual agent workflow builder | High |

### Developers (General)
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Documentation rot** — docs outdated within weeks | Auto-update docs from code changes | Medium |
| **[[API]] integration hell** — every SaaS has different auth/pagination | Universal [[API]] connector | High |
