# LLC Registration — Fast Path

*For [[Ainary Ventures]] entity setup.*

---

## Fastest LLC Registration

### 1. Choose State
- **NY** — If doing business locally
- **Delaware** — Investor-friendly, privacy, case law
- **Wyoming** — Low fees, privacy, no state income tax

**Note:** Investors prefer C-Corps for funds. Consult lawyer before finalizing.

### 2. File Articles of Organization
- NY: $200 at [dos.ny.gov](https://dos.ny.gov)
- Online filing, usually same-day processing

### 3. Get EIN (Free)
- IRS portal: [irs.gov EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)
- Takes 5 minutes
- Do this after LLC is filed
