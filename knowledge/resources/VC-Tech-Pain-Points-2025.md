# [[VC]] Tech Pain Points (2025)

*Opportunities in the gap between technical depth and investment decisions*

---

## The Core Problem

Most VCs are either:
- **Technical** but miss business model flaws
- **Business-focused** but can't assess technical moats

The best [[AI]] deals require **both**.

---

## Technical Gaps VCs Have

### 1. [[AI]] Evaluation
- Can't distinguish "real [[AI]]" from ChatGPT wrappers
- Don't understand RAG vs fine-tuning trade-offs
- Miss inference cost implications for unit economics
- Can't assess data moat quality

### 2. Infrastructure Depth
- DevOps/MLOps complexity underestimated
- Scaling challenges not understood
- Security/compliance blind spots
- Technical debt accumulation

### 3. Product-Technical Fit
- Building features that don't scale
- Choosing wrong architecture for use case
- Over-engineering vs under-engineering

---

## What Technical Founders Miss

### 1. Market Timing
- Building too early (market not ready)
- Building too late (competition saturated)
- Missing wedge opportunities

### 2. GTM Reality
- B2B sales cycles underestimated
- Enterprise procurement complexity
- Channel strategy gaps

### 3. Unit Economics
- CAC/LTV miscalculations
- Gross margin blind spots
- Scaling economics assumptions

---

## The Operator Advantage

Someone with **both** perspectives can:

1. **Spot fake [[AI]]** — When "proprietary [[AI]]" is just a wrapper
2. **Evaluate architecture** — Is this built to scale?
3. **Assess unit economics** — Will inference costs kill margins?
4. **Pattern match** — Seen these mistakes before

---

## Example Insight

> "This [[AI]] startup has incredible tech, but their inference costs make the unit economics impossible at scale."

Technical-only [[VC]]: Missed this
Business-only [[VC]]: Couldn't evaluate the tech
Operator [[VC]]: Caught it immediately

## Florian's Edge

| Pain Point | Your Experience |
|------------|-----------------|
| [[AI]] evaluation | Built production RAG (<0.2% hallucination) |
| Scaling challenges | Scaled 36ZERO through growth |
| Unit economics | Raised €5.5M, know the numbers |
| GTM reality | Sold to enterprises, understand cycles |
