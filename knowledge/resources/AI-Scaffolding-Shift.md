# The [[AI]] Scaffolding Shift

*Source: [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | 2026-02-01*

---

## The Core Insight

Tool-calling accuracy crossed **90%** (up from <50% two years ago).

This changes everything.

---

## What's Happening

```
OLD MODEL:
[User] → [Monolithic AI] → [Answer]

NEW MODEL:
[User] → [Executive AI] → [Specialist Agent 1]
                       → [Specialist Agent 2]
                       → [Specialist Agent 3]
                       → [Synthesized Answer]
```

Frontier models are becoming **executives**, not workers.

They route tasks to specialists and synthesize results.

---

## Why This Matters

### 1. Constellation > Monolith
One giant model trying to do everything loses to specialized agents working together.

### 2. The New Startup Opportunity
> "New opportunities emerge not from training the largest models, but from training the specialists the executives call first."

You don't need to build GPT-5. You need to build the **best specialist** for a domain.

### 3. Vertical [[AI]] Wins
Deep domain expertise + proprietary data = moat.

Generic [[AI]] assistants become commodities.

## Implications for [[Ainary-Ventures]]

**Thesis Validation:**
- Invest in vertical [[AI]] specialists
- Look for proprietary data + domain expertise
- Avoid "[[AI]] wrapper" plays without differentiation

**What to look for:**
- Domain-specific training data
- Integration depth (not just [[API]] wrapper)
- Feedback loops that improve with use

## Related to [[Legal-AI-Platform]]

This is exactly what we built:
- Questioner Agent (specialist)
- Researcher Agent (specialist)
- Validator Agent (specialist)
- Reporter Agent (synthesizer)

Multi-agent architecture with <0.2% hallucination.
