# AR-004 The [[AI]] Agent Maturity Model

## Executive Summary

- Every major [[AI]] maturity framework (Gartner, McKinsey, Deloitte, Microsoft, IBM, [[Google]] Cloud) measures [[AI]]-as-tool, not agents-as-actors — fundamental blind spot
- 62% experiment with agents, <10% deploy enterprise-wide, only 6% see EBIT impact — the gap is maturity, not technology
- AGENT framework introduces 5 dimensions: Autonomy, Governance, Error Handling, Networked Trust, Team Integration across 5 levels (Ad Hoc → Calibrated → Orchestrated → Autonomous)
- Level 3 (Calibrated) is the survival threshold for August 2026 EU [[AI]] Act enforcement — organizations below Level 3 face $2-5M compliance costs AND regulatory exposure
- 5-minute self-assessment with 10 binary questions — honest answer: 80%+ of organizations are at Level 1

## Key Insights

- **Maturity illusion:** 62% experimentation vs. <10% production deployment = stuck at Level 1, not slowly moving up
- **Five dimensions map to failures:** Autonomy (Knight Capital $440M), Governance (VW $7.5B), Error Handling (84% overconfidence), Networked Trust (45-64% MAS hijacking), Team Integration (67% alert fatigue)
- **Level 3 gatekeepers:** Calibrated confidence (not VCE), dedicated agent credentials (not personal [[API]] keys), memory governance (provenance tracking), measured SLAs (<2% hallucination)
- **Level 1 → 3 playbook:** Inventory (1-3 months, low cost), Calibration ($0.005/check, 3-9 months), Stop using VCE/random sampling
- **Existing models fail:** Gartner (no agent dimensions), McKinsey (no maturity ladder), Deloitte (no agent-specific), Microsoft (infrastructure-focused), [[Google]] Cloud (named Agent Trust but no framework update), IBM (data maturity, not agent)

## Sales Angles

- "You think you're at Level 3 because you have ChatGPT Enterprise. Our 5-minute assessment shows 80% of organizations are at Level 1. We get you to Level 3 before August 2026 enforcement."
- "The gap between 62% experimentation and <10% production isn't technology — it's maturity. We built the only agent-specific maturity model. Use it to diagnose where you're stuck."
- "Level 3 costs $0.005/check for calibration + $2-5M compliance. Level 1 when EU [[AI]] Act hits? Unlimited regulatory exposure. We deliver Level 3 in 9 months."
