# AR-003 The Transatlantic Divide

## Executive Summary

- EU [[AI]] Act full enforcement August 2026 with €35M or 7% global revenue penalties vs. US has zero federal [[AI]] regulation after rescinding Biden's EO
- EU compliance costs 5-20x higher than US equivalents ($2-5M initial setup)
- Neither framework actually defines or addresses [[AI]] agents specifically — multi-agent liability is a black hole in both jurisdictions
- EU [[AI]] Act has extraterritorial reach — if your [[AI]] system's output is used in the Union, you're in scope regardless of server location
- Pragmatic strategy: Build for EU compliance as floor, use US speed as ceiling

## Key Insights

- **Regulatory trilemma:** Deploy fast (US advantage) → no compliance → no insurance → unlimited liability
- **Agent-shaped hole:** EU [[AI]] Act defines "[[AI]] system" but not autonomous, goal-directed, multi-step agents — provider vs. deployer ambiguity in multi-agent chains
- **HITL paradox:** EU requires "effective human oversight" (Article 14) but 67% of SOC alerts ignored and 80-99% healthcare false positives — regulatory mandate meets empirical failure
- **State-by-state patchwork:** Colorado live Feb 2026, California SB 1047 vetoed, 40+ states with [[AI]] bills — US companies face 50 different compliance regimes
- **ISO 42001 bridge:** AWS first certified (Jan 2026) — voluntary standard that satisfies both EU conformity + US governance without being legally required in either

## Sales Angles

- "EU [[AI]] Act enforcement is 6 months away. €35M penalties vs. $2-5M compliance cost. We build the trust infrastructure that satisfies EU conformity AND makes you insurable in the US."
- "You need one governance framework that works in both markets. ISO 42001 + EU conformity + US state compliance. We deliver all three without triple the cost."
- "Regulatory arbitrage doesn't work anymore — EU extraterritorial reach means if Europeans use your [[AI]], you're in scope. Build compliance as your competitive moat."

## Content Ideas

- LinkedIn: "August 2, 2026: EU [[AI]] Act full enforcement. €35M max penalty. Most US companies don't realize extraterritorial reach means 'just don't sell to Europe' isn't a strategy anymore."
- Substack: "The Munich vs. NYC Experience" — same [[AI]] product, two incompatible regulatory realities, and why 'build fast in US, wrap compliance for EU' is the only viable strategy
- Policy Brief: "The Agent-Shaped Hole in Global [[AI]] Regulation" — why neither EU nor US frameworks address multi-agent liability chains
