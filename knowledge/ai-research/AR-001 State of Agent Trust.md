# AR-001 State of Agent Trust 2026

## Executive Summary

- The [[AI]] agent market will grow from $7.8B to $52B by 2030 (45.8% CAGR), yet 95% of corporate [[AI]] projects fail and 84% of [[LLM]]s are overconfident
- Only 6% of enterprises achieve meaningful EBIT impact from [[AI]] agents (McKinsey, n=1,993)
- Calibration infrastructure costs $0.005 per check vs. $4.4M average [[AI]]-related losses per company (EY, 99% of orgs report losses)
- EU [[AI]] Act enforcement begins August 2026 with €35M penalties; US has no federal framework after rescinding Biden's EO
- Three-layer trust gap: Communication (solved), Identity (emerging), Trustworthiness (missing) — no standardized trust-scoring protocol exists

## Key Insights

- **Overconfidence pandemic:** 84% of [[LLM]] outputs show confidence exceeding actual accuracy (PMC study, 9 models, 351 scenarios)
- **Trust erosion:** [[AI]] usage increased 13% but worker confidence dropped 18% (ManpowerGroup, n=14K)
- **Regulatory trilemma:** Must deploy fast OR compliant OR insured — can't have all three
- **Multi-agent amplification:** Verification chains without external calibration create false consensus, not quality assurance
- **Adversarial memory spiral:** Memory poisoning (>95% success) + no detection + propagation + human failure (67% alerts ignored) = self-reinforcing attack loop

## Sales Angles

- "Every company deploying [[AI]] agents is already paying the Trust Tax — most just haven't read the invoice yet. We help you see the $4.4M you're losing."
- "Your competitors use [[AI]] agents without trust infrastructure. The first major failure will create regulation overnight — be compliant before it's mandatory."
- "Calibration costs half a cent per check. One prevented VW-scale failure ($7.5B) pays for 55,555 years of calibration. The ROI is 1:1,500,000."
