# AR-008 [[AI]] Governance for Boards

## Executive Summary

- Only 22% of CEOs say their board effectively supports them on [[AI]] challenges — the competence gap is structural and widening
- EU [[AI]] Act high-risk enforcement begins August 2026 with penalties up to €35M or 7% of global revenue
- Caremark duty of oversight is extending to [[AI]] — directors who fail to monitor [[AI]] risk face personal liability under Delaware law
- 99% of enterprises report [[AI]]-related losses (EY 2025), yet most boards lack dedicated [[AI]] risk oversight structures
- The window between optional and mandatory [[AI]] governance is closing — directors who act now build defensibility, those who wait build liability

## Key Insights

- **Board composition gap:** Average director age 59.1 (up from 58.2), new appointments down 8% (lowest since 2016), only 43% of directors have expertise aligned with CEO's pressing issues — boards getting older/more insular as [[AI]] demands new competence
- **Regulatory clock ticking:** Feb 2025 (prohibited [[AI]] enforced), Aug 2025 (GPAI obligations), Aug 2026 (full high-risk enforcement), Aug 2027 (legacy systems must comply)
- **Caremark → [[AI]] extension:** "Mission critical" risks require affirmative board monitoring (Marchand v. Barnhill 2019) — [[AI]] in customer-facing/safety/compliance = mission critical, no monitoring = "utter failure," business judgment rule only protects informed decisions
- **Failure case pattern:** VW/Cariad ($7.5B), Air Canada (tribunal liability), McDonald's (discontinued), Klarna (reversed cuts) — every case = board either didn't ask about [[AI]] risk OR didn't understand answers
- **Seven questions every board must answer:** (1) Where are we deploying [[AI]]? (2) What is our [[AI]] risk taxonomy? (3) How do we validate outputs? (4) Incident response plan? (5) Compliance status? (6) Audit trail? (7) Adequate expertise?
