## Portfolio (Notable)
- Harvey AI
- ElevenLabs

## Relevance to Ainary
Conviction is the single most thesis-aligned fund for Ainary in the emerging VC landscape. Sarah Guo's "Software 3.0" thesis — that AI will rebuild entire software categories — directly overlaps with Ainary's AI-native investment focus. High co-invest potential at Seed-Series A, and deal flow sharing could be mutually valuable as both funds are building AI-specific portfolios. A relationship here is a top priority.

## Relationship

# LLC Registration — Fast Path

*For Ainary Ventures entity setup.*

---

## Fastest LLC Registration

### 1. Choose State
- **NY** — If doing business locally
- **Delaware** — Investor-friendly, privacy, case law
- **Wyoming** — Low fees, privacy, no state income tax

**Note:** Investors prefer C-Corps for funds. Consult lawyer before finalizing.

### 2. File Articles of Organization
- NY: $200 at [dos.ny.gov](https://dos.ny.gov)
- Online filing, usually same-day processing

### 3. Get EIN (Free)
- IRS portal: [irs.gov EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)
- Takes 5 minutes
- Do this after LLC is filed

---

## Formation Services

| Service | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **Stripe Atlas** | Tech startups, fast C-Corp |
| **Clerky** | YC-style docs |
| **ZenBusiness** | Budget LLCs |
| **Firstbase** | Non-US founders |

---

## LLC vs C-Corp for Funds

| Structure | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| **LLC** | Pass-through taxes, simpler | Investors may not like |
| **C-Corp** | Investors prefer, standard for VC | Double taxation, more complexity |

- Sägen: 45 €/h
- Entgraten: 31 €/h

## Zuschlagskalkulation (REFA-Standard)
- MGK (Materialgemeinkosten): 5%
- AV (Arbeitsvorbereitung): 12%
- VwGK (Verwaltungsgemeinkosten): 10%
- VtGK (Vertriebsgemeinkosten): 5%
- Gewinn: 8%

## Fachbegriffe (korrekt verwenden!)

# Sales Playbook — Was beim Verkaufen funktioniert

*Aktualisieren nach jedem Gespräch.*

## Validierte Pitch-Strategien

### Für Fertiger (CNC)
- **Einstieg:** Konkretes Problem nennen das SIE haben (Rüstzeit, Wissensverlust)
- **Beweis:** Live-Demo mit IHREN Bauteilen, IHREN Stundensätzen
- **ROI:** Euro-Beträge pro Jahr (nicht Prozente)
- **Referenz:** MBS als Pilotpartner
- **Close:** "Testen Sie 30 Tage kostenlos mit Ihren echten Aufträgen"

### Für Kommunen (Bürgermeister)
- **Einstieg:** Persönliche Verbindung + konkretes Verwaltungsproblem
- **Beweis:** Interaktives Dashboard (Tabs, Clickable, Wow-Faktor)
- **ROI:** Stunden/Woche gespart, nicht Euro
- **Förderung:** Als Anker zeigen (Kommune zahlt weniger als gedacht)
- **Close:** "20 Minuten, ich zeige Ihnen was möglich ist"
- **NIE:** Preise im Dashboard. Immer persönlich besprechen.

### Für Consulting (Mittelstand)
- **Einstieg:** "Was kostet Sie [Problem] pro Monat?"
- **Beweis:** 5 Live-Demos (Email-Triage, Briefing, QA, etc.)
- **ROI:** ~4.500€/Monat Ersparnis pro Betrieb
- **Förderung:** EFRE/go-digital als Türöffner
- **Close:** Discovery Workshop (3.500€)

## Anti-Patterns im Verkauf
- Zu viel erklären, zu wenig zuhören
- Funktionen statt Nutzen verkaufen
- Preis nennen bevor Wert klar ist
- Perfektes Deck > echtes Gespräch

# VC & Tech Pain Points — App/Workflow Opportunities

*Last updated: 2026-02-01*
*Status: Initial research — needs X validation*

---

## 🎯 For VCs / Investors

### Deal Sourcing & Pipeline
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Inbox overload** — 100+ cold pitches/week, hard to triage | AI pitch screener that scores fit vs thesis | Medium |
| **Missing warm intros** — best deals come via network, hard to track who knows who | Network graph + intro request automation | High |
| **Thesis drift** — hard to stay focused when everything looks interesting | Thesis alignment scorer for every deal | Low |
| **Duplicate outreach** — multiple partners reaching same founder | Shared CRM with collision detection | Low |

### Due Diligence
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Reference checks are manual** — 5-10 calls per deal, all notes scattered | AI-assisted reference call transcription + synthesis | Medium |
| **Competitive landscape mapping** — manual research takes days | Auto-generate market maps from pitch deck + web | Medium |
| **Financial model review** — founders send broken Excel, hard to validate | Model validator + red flag detector | Medium |
| **Background checks** — Googling founders is tedious | Automated founder profile builder (LinkedIn, news, social) | Low |

### Portfolio Management
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Quarterly updates ignored** — founders send PDFs, no one reads them | Update parser → dashboard + alerts for key metrics | Medium |
| **Follow-on timing** — hard to know when portfolio needs bridge | Runway tracker + proactive alert system | Low |
| **Intro requests from portfolio** — founders constantly need intros | Intro matching engine (portfolio ↔ LP/customer network) | High |

### LP Relations
| Problem | Opportunity | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Quarterly reports** — painful to compile, often delayed | Auto-generate LP reports from portfolio data | Medium |
| **LP CRM** — relationship tracking with potential/existing LPs | Dedicated LP pipeline tracker | Low |

# Dead Companies Walking (AI Era)

*Source: [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | 2026-02-01*

---

## The Six Failure Modes

### 1. Learning Only From Recent Past
SaaS multiples have been flat for 3 years. Companies optimizing for 2021 playbooks are already dead.

**Lesson:** The past is not a reliable guide. Look for structural shifts.

---

### 2. Over-Relying on Success Formulas
The sales motions that worked in 2020 don't work now:
- Buyers are more sophisticated
- AI changes evaluation criteria
- Procurement cycles have shifted

**Lesson:** What got you here won't get you there.

---

### 3. Misreading Customers
> 41% of AI spend is **net new budget**

This is massive. Companies thinking AI is just reshuffling existing spend are wrong.

**Lesson:** New budget categories emerge. Position for them.

---

### 4. Falling Victim to Mania
Having an "AI roadmap" ≠ delivered value.

Customers are learning to distinguish:
- Real AI capabilities
- Vaporware announcements
- Genuine product improvements

**Lesson:** Ship real value, not press releases.

...

# VC Terminology

*Reference for conversations, interviews, and your own fund.*

---

## Fund Structure

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **GP (General Partner)** | Fund managers who make investment decisions and manage the fund |
| **LP (Limited Partner)** | Investors who provide capital but don't manage the fund |
| **Management Fee** | Annual fee (typically 2%) charged by GP to cover operations |
| **Carried Interest (Carry)** | GP's share of profits (typically 20%) above a hurdle rate |
| **Hurdle Rate** | Minimum return LPs must receive before GP gets carry |
| **Fund Size / AUM** | Total capital committed to the fund |
| **Vintage Year** | Year the fund started making investments |
| **Fund Life** | Typical 10 years: ~5 investment period + ~5 harvest period |

---

## Investment Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pre-money Valuation** | Company value before new investment |
| **Post-money Valuation** | Company value after new investment (pre + new capital) |
| **Pro Rata** | Right to maintain ownership % in future rounds |
| **Anti-dilution** | Protection against down rounds |
| **Liquidation Preference** | Order and multiple of payout in exit (1x, 2x, participating) |
| **SAFE** | Simple Agreement for Future Equity (convertible instrument) |
| **Convertible Note** | Debt that converts to equity at next round |

# Microsoft's OpenAI Concentration Risk

*Source: [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | 2026-02-01*

---

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Microsoft RPO (total) | $625B |
| OpenAI portion | ~$281B |
| Concentration | **45%** |
| Stock reaction | -11% despite beat |

---

## Key Insight

> Even at $3T market cap, customer concentration kills you.

Microsoft beat earnings. Azure grew 39%. 150M monthly Copilot users.

**Still fell 11%.**

Why? Wall Street sees $281B riding on one customer relationship.

---

## Implications for Startups

### 1. Concentration Risk Scales
If Microsoft can get punished for customer concentration at $625B backlog, you will too at $6M ARR.

### 2. The "Best Customer" Trap
Your biggest customer feels like security. It's actually your biggest risk.

### 3. Diversification Isn't Optional
Rule of thumb: No customer > 20% of revenue.

# The AI Scaffolding Shift

*Source: [[Tomasz-Tunguz]] | 2026-02-01*

---

## The Core Insight

Tool-calling accuracy crossed **90%** (up from <50% two years ago).

This changes everything.

---

## What's Happening

```
OLD MODEL:
[User] → [Monolithic AI] → [Answer]

NEW MODEL:
[User] → [Executive AI] → [Specialist Agent 1]
                       → [Specialist Agent 2]
                       → [Specialist Agent 3]
                       → [Synthesized Answer]
```

Frontier models are becoming **executives**, not workers.

They route tasks to specialists and synthesize results.

---

## Why This Matters

### 1. Constellation > Monolith
One giant model trying to do everything loses to specialized agents working together.

### 2. The New Startup Opportunity
> "New opportunities emerge not from training the largest models, but from training the specialists the executives call first."

You don't need to build GPT-5. You need to build the **best specialist** for a domain.

### 3. Vertical AI Wins

# VC Tech Pain Points (2025)

*Opportunities in the gap between technical depth and investment decisions*

---

## The Core Problem

Most VCs are either:
- **Technical** but miss business model flaws
- **Business-focused** but can't assess technical moats

The best AI deals require **both**.

---

## Technical Gaps VCs Have

### 1. AI Evaluation
- Can't distinguish "real AI" from ChatGPT wrappers
- Don't understand RAG vs fine-tuning trade-offs
- Miss inference cost implications for unit economics
- Can't assess data moat quality

### 2. Infrastructure Depth
- DevOps/MLOps complexity underestimated
- Scaling challenges not understood
- Security/compliance blind spots
- Technical debt accumulation

### 3. Product-Technical Fit
- Building features that don't scale
- Choosing wrong architecture for use case
- Over-engineering vs under-engineering

---

## What Technical Founders Miss

### 1. Market Timing
- Building too early (market not ready)
- Building too late (competition saturated)
- Missing wedge opportunities

# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

*Your deep expertise area. Document what you know.*

---

## What It Is

RAG combines:
1. **Retrieval** — Find relevant documents/chunks from a knowledge base
2. **Generation** — LLM generates answer using retrieved context

---

## Key Components

### Embedding Models
- OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small/large`
- Cohere Embed
- Open source: `bge`, `e5`, `instructor`

### Vector Databases
- **Pinecone** — Managed, scales well
- **ChromaDB** — Local, lightweight (you use this)
- **Weaviate** — Hybrid search
- **Qdrant** — Fast, Rust-based

### Chunking Strategies
- Fixed size (512-1024 tokens)
- Semantic chunking
- Document-aware (respect headers, paragraphs)
- Sliding window with overlap

## Your Legal AI Implementation

*From your Legal AI Platform:*

- Sub-0.2% hallucination rate (how?)
- Multi-agent architecture:
  - **Questioner** — Clarifies query
  - **Researcher** — Retrieves + synthesizes
  - **Validator** — Checks accuracy

# Research Paper Clustering Pipeline

*For analyzing 2000+ paper corpus to identify research gaps.*

---

## Pipeline Architecture

```
1. Data Ingestion (PDFs → structured JSON)
   └── PyPDF2 for text extraction
   
2. Problem Extraction (Claude API)
   └── Structured prompts for problem/solution extraction
   
3. Embedding Generation (Specter2)
   └── allenai/specter2 via sentence-transformers
   
4. Clustering (HDBSCAN on UMAP-reduced embeddings)
   └── min_cluster_size=10, min_samples=5
   
5. Visualization (Plotly 3D scatter)
   └── Interactive HTML export
```

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### Embedding Model: Specter2
- Specifically trained on scientific papers
- Better semantic capture than general models
- HuggingFace: `allenai/specter2`

### Dimensionality Reduction: UMAP
- Preserves both local AND global structure (better than t-SNE)
- Faster on large corpora
- Non-linear (better than PCA)

```python
umap.UMAP(
    n_components=2,        # Or 3 for 3D visualization
