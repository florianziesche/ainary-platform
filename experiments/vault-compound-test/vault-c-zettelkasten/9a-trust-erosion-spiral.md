# The Trust Erosion Spiral is Self-Reinforcing

Cross-cutting: overconfidence → alert fatigue → HITL failure → catastrophe. Memory poisoning (>95%) feeds corrupted data. Overconfident calibration (84%) doesn't flag it. Alert fatigue (67% ignored) means humans miss it. The spiral accelerates.

This is the strongest cross-cutting finding: security, calibration, and human factors form a doom loop.
