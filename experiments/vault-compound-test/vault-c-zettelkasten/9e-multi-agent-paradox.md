# Multi-Agent Systems Amplify Both Value and Risk

MAS promise orchestrated intelligence but: cost 10-30x, hijacking 45-64%, false consensus, 40% cancellation. Anthropic: simple patterns outperform complex frameworks.

Paradox: industry builds toward multi-agent, evidence favors single-agent + simple orchestration.
