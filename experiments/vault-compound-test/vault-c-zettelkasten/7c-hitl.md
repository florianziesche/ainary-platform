# Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Regulatory requirement (EU AI Act Article 14) and operational necessity. The HITL paradox: regulation requires it but evidence shows it fails. 67% SOC alerts ignored. 80-99% healthcare false positives.

Improving calibration directly improves HITL by reducing noise.

Appears in: AR-002, AR-003, AR-006, AR-009.
