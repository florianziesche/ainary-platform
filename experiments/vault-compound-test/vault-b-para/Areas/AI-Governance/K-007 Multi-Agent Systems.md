# K-007: Multi-Agent Systems

Systems where multiple AI agents collaborate. Cost scales super-linearly (10-30x, not 5x). Nine failure modes including infinite loops, deadlocks, cascading failures.

Hijacking succeeds 45-64%. Inter-agent messages trusted by default. Verification chains create false consensus, not quality assurance.

Anthropic's counterintuitive finding: raw LLM API calls + simple patterns outperform complex multi-agent frameworks for most use cases.

**Appears in:** AR-001, AR-006, AR-007, AR-009
