# K-003: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

The regulatory and operational requirement for human oversight of AI systems. EU AI Act Article 14 mandates "effective human oversight."

The HITL paradox: regulation requires it, but empirical evidence shows it fails. 67% of SOC alerts ignored. 80-99% healthcare false positives. Alert fatigue turns HITL into rubber stamp.

When calibration is poor, HITL is overwhelmed with false signals and becomes ineffective. Improving calibration directly improves HITL effectiveness by reducing noise.
