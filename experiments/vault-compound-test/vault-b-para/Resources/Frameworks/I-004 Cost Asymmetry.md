# I-004: Extreme Cost Asymmetry Between Prevention and Failure

Consistent across reports:
- Calibration: $0.005/check vs. $4.4M losses (AR-009)
- Compliance: $2-5M setup vs. €35M penalties (AR-003)
- Trust infrastructure: $135/month vs. $7.5B VW failure (AR-009)
- Proactive vs. retroactive: 1x vs. 5-10x cost (AR-002)

The prevention-to-failure cost ratio ranges from 1:700 to 1:1,500,000. This is the strongest economic argument for trust infrastructure.
