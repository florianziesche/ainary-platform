# I-002: Calibration is the Keystone Intervention

At $0.005/check with ROI of 1:1,500,000, calibration appears in 7 of 9 reports as either a solution or a missing capability. It addresses:

- Overconfidence (AR-009): directly
- Alert fatigue (AR-002): reduces false signals → meaningful HITL
- Security (AR-006): detects anomalous confidence patterns
- Governance (AR-008): provides auditable trust metrics for boards
- Compliance (AR-003): satisfies "effective oversight" requirements
- Financial services (AR-005): enables trust scoring regulators demand
- Maturity (AR-004): Level 3 threshold requires calibrated confidence

No other single intervention touches this many problem domains.
