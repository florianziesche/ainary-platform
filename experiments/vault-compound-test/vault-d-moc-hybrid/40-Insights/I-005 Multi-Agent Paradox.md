# I-005: Multi-Agent Systems Amplify Both Value and Risk

Multi-agent systems (AR-007) promise orchestrated intelligence but empirically:
- Cost 10-30x (not linear) — AR-007
- Hijacking at 45-64% — AR-006
- False consensus from verification chains — AR-009
- 40% cancellation rate — AR-007

Yet Anthropic finds simple patterns outperform complex frameworks. The paradox: the industry builds toward multi-agent, but evidence favors single-agent + simple orchestration for most use cases.
