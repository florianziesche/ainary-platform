# I-003: Regulation Demands What Technology Can't Deliver

EU AI Act (AR-003) mandates "effective human oversight" (Article 14). But:
- 67% of alerts ignored (AR-002)
- HITL is empirically broken (AR-009)
- Prompt injection is unsolvable (AR-006)
- Multi-agent liability undefined (AR-003)

Regulators assume a world where human oversight works. Evidence shows it doesn't at scale. This creates a compliance theater risk: organizations technically compliant but practically unprotected.
