# K-009: Security

Agent attack surface is 7x larger than chatbots across 7 vectors. Prompt injection is fundamentally unsolvable (same modality for instructions and data).

Defense strategy: architectural constraints (privilege separation, deterministic guardrails, kill switches), not better prompt engineering.

Supply chain risk: MCP tool servers = npm packages with no code review, no signing, no sandbox.

**Appears in:** AR-001, AR-005, AR-006, AR-007
