# K-005: Compounding

The principle that knowledge generates increasing returns when properly structured. Trust Debt compounds negatively at 5-10x. Calibration ROI compounds positively at 1:1,500,000.

Multi-agent systems can compound errors (overconfidence amplification) or compound value (orchestrated correctly). The architecture of knowledge storage determines whether compounding is positive or negative.

Reports show compounding in: trust erosion spiral (negative), calibration infrastructure ROI (positive), regulatory compliance (builds defensibility over time).
