# K-006: Regulation

EU AI Act: Full enforcement August 2026, €35M penalties. US: Zero federal framework after Biden EO rescinded. State patchwork (40+ bills).

Regulatory trilemma: Deploy fast OR compliant OR insured — can't have all three. ISO 42001 as bridge standard.

Agent-shaped hole: Neither jurisdiction defines AI agents specifically. Multi-agent liability = black hole. EU has extraterritorial reach.
