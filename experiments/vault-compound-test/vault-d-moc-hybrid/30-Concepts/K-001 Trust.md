# K-001: Trust

Trust is the central theme across all Ainary reports. Three-layer trust gap: Communication (solved), Identity (emerging), Trustworthiness (missing). No standardized trust-scoring protocol exists.

Trust Tax = hidden costs of deploying AI without trust infrastructure ($4.4M avg losses). Trust Debt compounds at 5-10x if not addressed proactively.

Trust erosion spiral: overconfidence → discovery → alert fatigue → binary choice → catastrophe.

**Appears in:** AR-001, AR-002, AR-004, AR-005, AR-008, AR-009
