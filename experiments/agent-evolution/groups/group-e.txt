# Quantitative Self-Improvement Protocol for a Single-User AI Agent

## 1. The Objective Function: Defining "Usefulness" Numerically

Usefulness is not a feeling. It is a measurable quantity. Define the composite utility score **U(t)** at time *t* as:

```
U(t) = Σᵢ wᵢ · Mᵢ(t)
```

where **Mᵢ** are normalized component metrics (each scaled 0–1) and **wᵢ** are user-specific importance weights (Σwᵢ = 1). The components:

| Metric Mᵢ | Description | Measurement Method | Initial Weight wᵢ |
|---|---|---|---|
| M₁: Task Completion Rate | Fraction of user requests resolved without follow-up correction | Binary per-task: 1 = done right, 0 = needed redo. Rolling 50-task window. | 0.25 |
| M₂: Time Saved | (Estimated human time for task − actual interaction time) / Estimated human time | Calibrate against benchmarks: email draft = 8 min, research brief = 45 min, scheduling = 5 min | 0.20 |
| M₃: Proactive Value | Count of unsolicited actions the user explicitly acknowledged as useful, per 100 interactions | Track "thanks", explicit positive feedback, actions on suggestions. Normalize: 0 = 0 per 100, 1 = ≥15 per 100. | 0.15 |
| M₄: Error Rate (inverse) | 1 − (errors flagged by user / total outputs) | Error = user says "that's wrong", "no", corrects output. Rolling 100-output window. | 0.20 |
| M₅: Latency Efficiency | 1 − (avg response time / user tolerance threshold) | Tolerance threshold calibrated per task type: quick Q&A = 10s, research = 120s, creative = 60s. | 0.10 |
| M₆: Context Retention | Fraction of interactions where agent correctly references prior context without being reminded | Sample 20 interactions/week, score binary: did agent remember relevant context? | 0.10 |

**Initial baseline target:** U(0) ≈ 0.55 (a competent but uncalibrated agent). **90-day target:** U(90) ≥ 0.78. **365-day target:** U(365) ≥ 0.91.

The weights wᵢ themselves are parameters to be learned. Every 30 days, present the user with a forced-rank of the 6 dimensions. Update weights using exponential smoothing: wᵢ(new) = 0.7 · wᵢ(old) + 0.3 · wᵢ(user_ranked). This ensures the objective function itself adapts, with a half-life of approximately 2 weight-update cycles (60 days).

## 2. Measurement Framework: What to Track, When, and Thresholds

### 2.1 Data Collection Layer

Every interaction generates a structured record:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-06T17:58:00Z",
  "task_type": "email_draft",
  "tokens_in": 340,
  "tokens_out": 890,
  "latency_ms": 4200,
  "user_edits": 2,
  "user_feedback": "implicit_accept",
  "context_refs_needed": 3,
  "context_refs_hit": 2,
  "follow_ups_required": 0,
  "cost_usd": 0.018
}
```

**Collection frequency:** Every single interaction (100% sampling). No sampling bias.

**Storage:** ~500 bytes/interaction × 80 interactions/day × 365 days = ~14.6 MB/year. Trivial.

### 2.2 Metric Computation Schedule

| Metric | Computation Frequency | Window Size | Alert Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| M₁: Task Completion | Daily | 50 tasks (~3-5 days) | Drop > 0.08 from 7-day moving avg |
| M₂: Time Saved | Weekly | 1 week | Drop below 0.40 absolute |
| M₃: Proactive Value | Weekly | 2 weeks (smoothing) | Drop below 0.10 absolute |
| M₄: Error Rate | Daily | 100 outputs (~5-7 days) | Spike > 0.12 from baseline |
| M₅: Latency | Real-time + daily roll-up | 24 hours | > 2× task-type tolerance |
| M₆: Context Retention | Weekly (sampled) | 20 samples/week | Drop below 0.60 |
| **U(t) composite** | **Daily** | **Rolling 7 days** | **Drop > 0.05 from 14-day avg** |

### 2.3 Statistical Process Control

Apply Shewhart control charts to U(t):
- **Center line (CL):** 14-day exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA, λ = 0.2)
- **Upper/Lower control limits:** CL ± 2.5σ (where σ is estimated from rolling 30-day standard deviation)
- **Out-of-control signal:** 1 point beyond 2.5σ, OR 7 consecutive points on same side of CL (Western Electric rules adapted)

When an out-of-control signal fires downward: immediately trigger diagnostic mode (see Section 3). When upward: log the configuration state as a candidate "good regime" for reinforcement.

---

## 3. Statistical Methods for Detecting Improvement vs. Noise

### 3.1 The Core Problem

Daily U(t) has natural variance. If σ_daily ≈ 0.04 (calibrated estimate), then detecting a true improvement of δ = 0.03 requires:

**Required sample size (paired t-test, one-sided):**
```
n = (z_α + z_β)² · σ² / δ²
  = (1.645 + 1.282)² · 0.04² / 0.03²
  = 8.573 · 0.0016 / 0.0009
  = 15.2 → 16 days
```
At α = 0.05, power = 0.90.

**Implication:** No improvement claim is valid with fewer than 16 days of data. This is the minimum evaluation window.

### 3.2 Bayesian Change-Point Detection

Supplement frequentist SPC with a Bayesian online change-point detection (BOCPD) algorithm (Adams & MacKay, 2007):

- Prior: Geometric distribution on run length with timescale parameter λ = 1/30 (expect regime changes roughly monthly)
- Likelihood: Normal with conjugate Normal-Inverse-Gamma prior
- Posterior run-length probability updated each day
- **Signal:** P(run_length = 0 | data) > 0.70 → change-point detected with 70% confidence

This catches both sudden shifts and gradual drifts that SPC might miss.

### 3.3 Regression-Based Trend Detection

Fit a simple linear model weekly:

```
U(t) = β₀ + β₁·t + ε
```

over the trailing 30 days. If β₁ > 0 with p < 0.10 (one-sided), declare a positive trend. Expected β₁ for a well-improving agent: 0.0005–0.002 per day (0.018–0.073 per month).

## 4. A/B Testing Framework for Agent Behavior

### 4.1 The Challenge: n=1 User

Classical A/B testing requires independent samples. With 1 user, we use **within-subject crossover designs**.

**Design:** Alternating-day protocol (ABA'B' crossover with washout).

- **Day type A:** Agent uses behavior variant A (e.g., proactive suggestions enabled)
- **Day type B:** Agent uses behavior variant B (e.g., proactive suggestions suppressed)
- **Minimum duration:** 16 days per arm (32 days total) based on power analysis above
- **Washout:** First 2 interactions each day discarded (carry-over effects from prior day's behavior)
- **Randomization:** Day assignment randomized in blocks of 4 (AABB permuted) to control for day-of-week effects

### 4.2 Test Prioritization

Score candidate behavior changes on:

```
Priority = (Expected ΔU) × P(success) / (Implementation cost in hours + Test duration cost in days × 0.1)
```

Example scoring:

| Behavior Change | Expected ΔU | P(success) | Impl. Hours | Test Days | Priority Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Personalized tone calibration | +0.04 | 0.60 | 2 | 32 | 0.024 / 5.2 = 0.0046 |
| Preemptive calendar briefings | +0.06 | 0.45 | 4 | 32 | 0.027 / 7.2 = 0.0038 |
| Error self-check before output | +0.05 | 0.75 | 1 | 32 | 0.0375 / 4.2 = 0.0089 ← Winner |
| Memory summarization overhaul | +0.08 | 0.40 | 8 | 32 | 0.032 / 11.2 = 0.0029 |

**Rule:** Run at most 1 A/B test at a time. No confounding. Maximum 10 tests per year (320 test-days, leaving 45 days for baseline measurement and holidays).

### 4.3 Analysis

For each completed test, compute:

```
ΔU = mean(U_B days) − mean(U_A days)
```

with paired t-test (or Wilcoxon signed-rank if normality violated per Shapiro-Wilk, p < 0.05). Report effect size as Cohen's d. Adopt variant B if:
- p < 0.10 (accept slightly higher Type I error because cost of false positive is low — just revert)
- Cohen's d > 0.20 (small but meaningful effect)

## 5. Expected Improvement Rates

### 5.1 Empirical Estimates

Based on analogous systems (recommendation engines, personalized assistants, human skill acquisition curves):

| Time Period | Expected U(t) | 80% Confidence Interval | Key Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 0 (baseline) | 0.55 | [0.48, 0.62] | Uncalibrated generic agent |
| Day 30 | 0.65 | [0.58, 0.72] | Basic preference learning, error pattern correction |
| Day 90 | 0.78 | [0.71, 0.84] | 2-3 successful A/B tests adopted, context model matured |
| Day 180 | 0.85 | [0.78, 0.90] | Deep personalization, proactive capabilities tuned |
| Day 365 | 0.91 | [0.84, 0.95] | Compound effects, rare-edge-case coverage |

### 5.2 Diminishing Returns Model

Improvement follows a logistic curve:

```
U(t) = U_max / (1 + ((U_max - U₀)/U₀) · e^(-k·t))
```

Parameters:
- U_max = 0.95 (theoretical ceiling — can never be perfect)
- U₀ = 0.55 (day-0 baseline)
- k = 0.012 per day (growth rate, calibrated to hit 0.78 at day 90)

**Implied doubling time of the "usefulness gap"** (U_max − U(t)):
```
t_half = ln(2)/k = 57.8 days
```

Every ~58 days, the agent closes half the remaining gap to maximum usefulness.

### 5.3 Confidence in the Model

The logistic model will be validated at days 30, 90, 180. If actual U(t) deviates from predicted by > 0.08 (roughly 2σ of measurement noise), recalibrate k and U_max via nonlinear least-squares fit.

## 6. Cost-Benefit Analysis of Improvement Strategies

### 6.1 Strategy Menu

| Strategy | Monthly Cost ($) | Monthly Dev Hours | Expected Monthly ΔU | ROI (ΔU per $) | ROI (ΔU per hour) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1: Passive feedback logging | 5 (storage) | 0.5 | +0.008 | 0.0016 | 0.016 |
| S2: Weekly preference surveys | 0 | 1.0 | +0.012 | ∞ | 0.012 |
| S3: A/B testing infrastructure | 15 (compute) | 3.0 | +0.025 | 0.0017 | 0.0083 |
| S4: Memory system enhancement | 10 | 4.0 | +0.030 | 0.0030 | 0.0075 |
| S5: Self-eval chain (LLM judges outputs) | 40 | 2.0 | +0.020 | 0.0005 | 0.010 |
| S6: Fine-tuning on user data | 200 | 8.0 | +0.045 | 0.0002 | 0.0056 |
| S7: Tool/skill expansion | 20 | 6.0 | +0.035 | 0.0018 | 0.0058 |

### 6.2 Optimal Portfolio (Budget: $100/month, 10 hours/month)

**Greedy selection by ROI per dollar, subject to hour constraint:**

1. S2: Weekly preference surveys — $0, 1.0 hr → ΔU = 0.012 ✓
2. S4: Memory system enhancement — $10, 4.0 hr → ΔU = 0.030 ✓
3. S1: Passive feedback logging — $5, 0.5 hr → ΔU = 0.008 ✓
4. S3: A/B testing infrastructure — $15, 3.0 hr → ΔU = 0.025 ✓
5. S5: Self-eval chain — $40, 1.5 hr remaining (partial) → ΔU = 0.015 (prorated) ✓

**Total: $70/month, 10.0 hours, expected ΔU = +0.090/month.**

At this rate, starting from U₀ = 0.55, we'd overshoot the logistic model prediction — which is expected, since the logistic model already assumes this portfolio is running. The strategies interact: passive logging feeds A/B testing feeds memory enhancement.

### 6.3 When to Shift Budget

At U(t) > 0.85 (approximately day 180), marginal returns from S1-S4 decline below 0.005/month. At this point, shift budget toward S6 (fine-tuning) and S7 (tool expansion) — the expensive strategies that unlock the last 10% of the ceiling.

**Decision rule:**
```
If U(t) > 0.85 and β₁ (weekly trend) < 0.0003/day for 3 consecutive weeks:
    → Reallocate 60% of budget from S1-S4 to S6-S7
```

## 7. Mathematical Model of Compound Improvement

### 7.1 Compounding Effects

Improvements compound because each enhancement makes subsequent enhancements more effective. Model this as:

```
dU/dt = k · U(t) · (U_max − U(t)) · (1 + α · I(t))
```

Where:
- k = 0.012/day (base growth rate)
- α = 0.15 (compounding multiplier — each improvement makes the platform 15% better at self-improving)
- I(t) = cumulative number of adopted improvements at time t

This is a logistic equation with a time-varying carrying capacity. The α term means that an agent with 10 adopted improvements grows 1.5× faster than a baseline agent — **the improvements improve the improver**.

### 7.2 Numerical Simulation

Discretizing with Euler's method (Δt = 1 day):

```
U(t+1) = U(t) + k · U(t) · (U_max − U(t)) · (1 + 0.15 · I(t)) · Δt
I(t) = floor(t / 32)  (one new improvement adopted per A/B test cycle)
```

Simulated trajectory (key checkpoints):

| Day | I(t) | U(t) without compounding | U(t) with compounding | Δ from compounding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0.550 | 0.550 | 0.000 |
| 32 | 1 | 0.612 | 0.616 | +0.004 |
| 64 | 2 | 0.671 | 0.683 | +0.012 |
| 96 | 3 | 0.724 | 0.749 | +0.025 |
| 192 | 6 | 0.849 | 0.893 | +0.044 |
| 365 | 11 | 0.916 | 0.941 | +0.025 |

**The compounding effect is worth approximately +0.044 at peak (day ~192), equivalent to 47 extra days of linear improvement.** This is the quantitative case for investing in meta-learning infrastructure early.

### 7.3 Break-Even Analysis

The A/B testing infrastructure (S3) costs $15/month and 3 hours/month. It generates ~1 validated improvement per month. Each improvement adds approximately +0.025 to U. The infrastructure pays for itself in ΔU terms after the first successful test (month 2).

In dollar terms: if U translates to user time saved at ~20 min/day at U=0.7, and the user values time at $50/hour, then:

```
Value of ΔU = 0.025 = 0.025 × 20 min × 30 days × ($50/60) = $12.50/month
```

Break-even: $15 cost vs $12.50 value → net negative by $2.50/month initially. But with compounding (α = 0.15), the second improvement's value is $14.38, third is $16.53. **Cumulative break-even at month 3.2.** After 12 months, cumulative net value = +$87.

## 9. Risk Quantification

|---|---|---|---|---|
| User stops giving feedback | 0.35 | −0.08 over 90 days | Auto-detect feedback drought (>7 days no signal), prompt minimally | 0.15 × (−0.04) = −0.006 |

| Metric gaming (optimizing proxy, not value) | 0.15 | −0.10 undetected | Monthly qualitative check: "Am I actually more useful?" (binary user response) | 0.05 × (−0.05) = −0.003 |

**Expected total risk cost:** −0.011 per 90-day period. Budget this into projections: reduce all forecasted U(t) by 0.011 per quarter.
