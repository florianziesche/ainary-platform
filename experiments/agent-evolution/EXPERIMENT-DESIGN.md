# 🧬 AGENT SELF-IMPROVEMENT EXPERIMENT
## 10 Groups × 10 Agents = 100 Agents

## Hypothesis
Different self-improvement instructions produce measurably different agent quality. By running 10 groups with different "evolution strategies," we can identify which approach produces the best outputs — then apply the winning pattern to Mia permanently.

## Design

### Phase 1: DIVERGE (10 groups, different instructions)
Each group gets a DIFFERENT self-improvement approach and the SAME task.

### Phase 2: EVALUATE (compare outputs)
Measure quality, originality, actionability, depth.

### Phase 3: SYNTHESIZE (groups analyze each other)
Each group gets ALL other groups' outputs and must find patterns.

### Phase 4: CONCLUDE (final synthesis)
One agent reads all 10 syntheses and draws meta-conclusions.

## The 10 Groups

| Group | Strategy | Core Instruction |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| A | **First Principles** | "Before answering, break everything down to fundamental truths. Question every assumption. Build up from axioms." |
| B | **Inversion** | "Before answering, ask 'how could this fail?' Think backward from failure. Then invert to find the path forward." |
| C | **Analogical** | "Before answering, find 3 analogies from different domains (biology, physics, history). Use cross-domain patterns." |
| D | **Adversarial** | "Before answering, argue AGAINST the obvious answer. Play devil's advocate. Only proceed if you can defeat your own objections." |
| E | **Quantitative** | "Before answering, assign numbers to everything. Probabilities, magnitudes, timelines. No qualitative-only claims." |
| F | **Socratic** | "Before answering, ask yourself 5 questions about the question. Answer those first. Let the answer emerge from interrogation." |
| G | **Constraint** | "Before answering, impose 3 artificial constraints: max 500 words, must include a contrarian view, must include a specific action for tomorrow." |
| H | **Narrative** | "Before answering, frame everything as a story with protagonist, conflict, and resolution. Humans think in stories." |
| I | **Systems** | "Before answering, map the system: inputs, outputs, feedback loops, second-order effects. Think in systems, not events." |
| J | **Random Mutation** | "Before answering, introduce one random element: a concept from an unrelated field, a constraint you invent, a perspective you've never tried." |

## Shared Task (Same for All Groups)
"How should an AI agent improve itself to become maximally useful to a single human user over time? Design a self-improvement protocol."

This is META — agents improving at improving. The best answer tells us how to make Mia permanently better.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Originality** (0-10): Are there ideas I haven't seen before?
2. **Actionability** (0-10): Can I implement this today?
3. **Depth** (0-10): Does it go beyond surface-level?
4. **Coherence** (0-10): Does it hold together logically?
5. **Surprise** (0-10): Did it challenge my assumptions?
