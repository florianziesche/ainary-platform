# S1 — Ersttermin-Prep 🎯
> Version 1.0 | Created 2026-02-19 | Tag: [SALES]

## 1. IDENTITY

**🎯 S1: Ersttermin-Prep**

**What:** Produces a complete, actionable meeting prep package for any first client meeting — from Bürgermeister to VC to manufacturer. Output: a 1-page Meeting Brief + supporting docs, ready in 30 minutes.

**For Whom:** Florian (walking into the meeting), Agents (research & prep), Platform (activity log).

**Quality Level:** Every meeting brief must pass the "Parkplatz-Test" — Florian reads it in 2 minutes on the parking lot, knows exactly what to say, ask, and avoid.

**Time Budget:** 30 minutes total. 45 min max for high-stakes meetings (>€50K). If exceeding 45 min, scope is wrong.

---

## 2. TRIGGER

Use S1 when:
- First meeting with a potential client, partner, or stakeholder
- Keywords: "Ersttermin", "Kennenlernen", "Erstgespräch", "Discovery Call", "Pitch Meeting", "Vorstellungstermin"
- Any meeting where Ainary is being evaluated or positioning for a deal

Do NOT use S1 when:
- Follow-up meeting with existing contact → use meeting notes template
- Internal planning → not a client meeting
- Conference/networking → too unstructured for formal prep
- Already have a signed contract → different phase

---

## 3. INPUTS REQUIRED

Before starting S1, you need:

### Must-Have
- [ ] **Who** — Full name, title, organization of counterpart(s)
- [ ] **When/Where** — Date, time, location (or video link)
- [ ] **Context** — How did this meeting come about? (referral, cold outreach, inbound)
- [ ] **Goal** — What does Florian want from this meeting? (pilot, partnership, intro to decision-maker)
- [ ] **Budget Range** — What's the realistic deal size? (€5K, €15-30K, €100K+)

### Nice-to-Have
- [ ] Previous communication (emails, messages)
- [ ] Known pain points or interests mentioned
- [ ] Org chart / decision-making structure
- [ ] Competitor presence (are they already working with someone?)
- [ ] Funding situation (public sector: Fördermittel? Private: budget cycle?)

If you're missing 2+ Must-Haves, ask Florian before proceeding. Bad inputs = bad prep.

---

## 4. PROCESS

### Step 1: Research Counterpart (10 min)

**Person Research:**
- LinkedIn profile (role, tenure, background, recent posts)
- Google: "[Name] [Organization]" — press mentions, interviews, speeches
- For public sector: Ratsinformationssystem, local press, council decisions
- For private sector: Company website, Handelsregister, recent news

**Organization Research:**
- Size (employees, revenue/budget, geography)
- Current challenges (news, industry trends, public statements)
- Digital maturity (website quality, online services, tech stack if visible)
- Political/strategic context (elections, restructuring, growth phase)

**Extract:** 3 pain points we can address, 2 things they're proud of (to reference), 1 potential blocker.

### Step 2: Craft the Offer (5 min)

**Rule: No generic "AI consulting" pitch.** Tailor to their world.

Map their pain points to Ainary capabilities:
- Pain Point → Ainary Solution → Concrete Example → Expected Impact
- Use their language, not ours (Bürgermeister: "Bürgernähe" not "customer experience")
- Size the offer to their budget reality (municipality ≠ DAX company)
- Identify funding paths (Förderprogramme, Digitalpakt, internal budgets)

### Step 3: Anticipate Objections (5 min)

For every counterpart type, expect 5 objections. Prepare responses that:
- Acknowledge the concern (never dismiss)
- Reframe with evidence or analogy
- Offer a risk-reducing structure (pilot, phased, success-based)

Use the **"Yes, and..."** pattern from McKinsey's SCR framework: Situation → Complication → Resolution.

### Step 4: Prepare the Ask (3 min)

**Every meeting needs a clear ask.** Not "let's stay in touch."

Calibrate the ask to the meeting:
- **Cold/First contact:** Ask for a follow-up meeting with decision-makers
- **Warm/Referred:** Ask for a paid pilot scope discussion
- **Hot/They reached out:** Ask for timeline and budget confirmation

Also prepare a **fallback ask** (if primary ask feels too aggressive):
- Primary: "Sollen wir einen konkreten Pilot-Vorschlag aufsetzen?"
- Fallback: "Darf ich Ihnen bis Freitag 2-3 konkrete Ideen schicken?"

### Step 5: Build Meeting Brief (5 min)

Fill in the Output Template below. Print or save to phone. Done.

### Step 6: Quality Gate (2 min)

Run the checklist in Section 6. Fix any gaps. Ship.

## 5. OUTPUT TEMPLATE

### 📋 MEETING BRIEF (1-Pager — this is what Florian reads on the Parkplatz)

```markdown

> 📅 [Date] | ⏰ [Time] | 📍 [Location]
> 🎯 Goal: [One sentence — what success looks like]
> 💰 Deal potential: [€X-Y] | Funding: [self-funded / Fördermittel / mixed]

## Agenda (45-60 min)

## 3 Talking Points

### 💡 OUR OFFER (tailored, not generic)

```markdown
## Ainary für [Organization]: [Headline — one sentence value prop]

| Pain Point | Solution | Example | Impact |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| [Their problem 1] | [Our approach] | [Concrete: "Wir haben für X..."] | [Metric or outcome] |
| [Their problem 2] | [Our approach] | [Concrete example] | [Metric or outcome] |
| [Their problem 3] | [Our approach] | [Concrete example] | [Metric or outcome] |

### Pilot-Vorschlag
- **Scope:** [What we'd do in 4-8 weeks]
- **Investment:** [€X-Y, phased if possible]
- **Deliverable:** [What they get — tangible]
- **Funding:** [Fördermittel-Option if applicable]
- **Risk for them:** [Minimal — pilot structure, exit clause]
```

### 🛡️ OBJECTION HANDLING

```markdown
| # | Objection | Response |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | [Most likely objection] | [Acknowledge → Reframe → Evidence → Offer] |
| 2 | [Second most likely] | [...] |
| 3 | [Third] | [...] |
| 4 | [Fourth] | [...] |
| 5 | [Fifth] | [...] |
```

**Universal objections to always prepare:**
1. "Wir haben kein Budget dafür" → Fördermittel + Pilot-Struktur + ROI in 3 Monaten
2. "AI ist noch nicht so weit" → Live-Demo. Zeigen > Erzählen.
3. "Wir sind zu klein dafür" → "Gerade kleine Organisationen profitieren — weniger Bürokratie, schnellere Umsetzung"
4. "Datenschutz / Sicherheit" → On-premise möglich, DSGVO-konform, keine Cloud-Pflicht
5. "Wir haben das intern versucht" → "Genau deshalb — ein externer Blick + AI-Expertise spart Monate"

## 7. KNOWN FAILURE MODES

| Failure | How it manifests | Prevention |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| **Monolog-Modus** | Florian talks 70%+ of the time, learns nothing | Agenda rule: "Ihre Situation" = 15 min LISTENING. Prepare questions, not speeches. Source: Winning by Design, "Discovery calls need to be conversations" (2016) |
| **Generic Pitch** | "AI kann alles!" — counterpart zones out | Tailored offer with THEIR pain points, THEIR language. No solution without their problem first. |
| **Kein Ask** | Meeting ends with "toll, wir melden uns" | Always have Primary Ask + Fallback Ask. Rehearse the transition sentence. |
| **Over-Engineering** | 3-hour prep for a 30-min coffee | Time-box: 30 min prep. If you need more, scope is wrong or stakes justify 45 min max. |
| **Assumption Bias** | Prep assumes pain points that don't exist | First 15 min = listening. Validate assumptions before pitching. Adjust in real-time. |
| **Tech-Demo ohne Kontext** | Showing AI capabilities nobody asked for | Demo only what maps to their stated problems. "Based on what you just told me..." |
| **Zu früh über Preis reden** | Price anchoring before value is established | Deflect early price questions: "Lassen Sie mich erst verstehen, was genau Sie brauchen." |
| **Follow-Up vergessen** | Great meeting, no follow-up within 24h | Follow-Up Plan is part of the prep. Calendar reminder BEFORE the meeting. Source: Salesforce Discovery Call Guide (2024) |
| **Nicht den Entscheider treffen** | Perfect pitch to someone who can't decide | Research decision structure beforehand. If unclear, ask early: "Wer ist noch in die Entscheidung eingebunden?" |
