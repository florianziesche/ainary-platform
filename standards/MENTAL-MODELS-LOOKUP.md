**Situation → Model → Action**

---

## Purpose
When you're stuck, pick the right mental model for the problem. Don't just "think harder" — use a framework that's already solved this class of problem.

**Usage:** Match your situation below → Apply the models → Get unstuck.

---

## 1. NEGOTIATING

**Situation:** Making a deal, salary discussion, client pricing, partnership terms

**Models:**
- **Chris Voss (Never Split the Difference)**
  - Tactical empathy: "It seems like..."
  - Mirroring: Repeat last 3 words as question
  - Calibrated questions: "How am I supposed to do that?"
  - Accusation audit: "You probably think I'm being unreasonable..."
  - Get to "That's right" (not "You're right")
  
- **Cialdini (Influence)**
  - Reciprocity: Give first
  - Commitment & consistency: Get small yes first
  - Social proof: "Others in your situation chose..."
  - Liking: Build genuine rapport
  - Authority: Position yourself as expert
  - Scarcity: "This window closes..."
  
- **Machiavelli (The Prince)**
  - "It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both"
  - Never reveal all your options
  - Coalitions > solo power
  - Control the frame

**Action:** Prepare with accusation audit → Mirror to build rapport → Calibrated questions to find their constraints → Anchor high, reciprocity to close.

## 2. STUCK / PROCRASTINATING

**Situation:** Can't start, can't focus, overwhelmed, avoiding hard tasks

**Models:**
- **Atomic Habits (James Clear)**
  - Identity-based: "I'm the type of person who..."
  - 2-minute rule: Scale it down until it's stupid easy
  - Environment design: Make good default, bad hard
  - Habit stacking: After [existing habit], I will [new habit]
  
- **Deep Work (Cal Newport)**
  - Shutdown ritual (end work decisively)
  - Time blocking (assign every minute)
  - Attention residue: Single task blocks, no switching
  - Boredom training: Build focus muscle
  
- **The Goal (Theory of Constraints, Goldratt)**
  - Find THE bottleneck (only one matters)
  - Exploit it (get max from constraint)
  - Subordinate everything else to it
  - Elevate the constraint (break through it)
  - Repeat (find next bottleneck)

**Action:** Find the ONE bottleneck (likely focus or activation energy) → 2-minute version to start → Time block deep work → Environment makes default easy.

---

## 3. HARD DECISION

**Situation:** Job offers, career pivots, major investment, strategic direction

**Models:**
- **Thinking in Bets (Annie Duke)**
  - Decisions ≠ outcomes (don't judge by result)
  - Range of outcomes + probabilities, not single prediction
  - "Wanna bet?" (forces probabilistic thinking)
  - Backcasting: "In 2 years, I'm thrilled/regretful. Why?"
  - Pre-mortem: "This failed. What happened?"
  
- **Black Swan (Nassim Taleb)**
  - Asymmetry: What's the max downside vs upside?
  - Barbell strategy: Safe + wild bets, avoid middle
  - Via negativa: What can you REMOVE?
  - Skin in the game: Are advisors risking anything?
  
- **Stockdale Paradox (Jim Collins)**
  - Confront brutal facts (unflinching realism)
  - Retain unwavering faith (you'll prevail)
  - "I never doubted I'd get out, but..."
  - Don't confuse faith with false optimism

**Action:** Map range of outcomes + probabilities → Asymmetry analysis (max downside/upside?) → Pre-mortem (assume it fails, why?) → Barbell test (is this safe, wild, or mediocre middle?) → Decide.

---

## 4. WRITING CONTENT

**Situation:** Blog post, LinkedIn, pitch deck, email, presentation

**Models:**
- **Made to Stick (Heath Brothers)**
  - SUCCESs: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories
  - Curse of knowledge: Unbake the cake (forget what you know)
  - Velcro theory: Ideas stick when they're SUCCESsful
  - Commander's intent: The ONE thing that must survive
  
- **Start With Why (Simon Sinek)**
  - Golden Circle: Why → How → What (inside out)
  - People don't buy WHAT, they buy WHY
  - "People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it"
  
- **Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)**
  - Answer first (BLUF)
  - Group and summarize (MECE branches)
  - Logical order: Deductive (major → minor) or Inductive (facts → conclusion)

**Action:** Start with Why → Answer first (Pyramid) → Make it stick (SUCCESs formula) → Commander's intent test (if they remember ONE thing, what is it?).

---

## 5. BUILDING SOMETHING NEW

**Situation:** Product, business, service, MVP, side project

**Models:**
- **Lean Startup (Eric Ries)**
  - Build-Measure-Learn loop (minimize time)
  - MVP = minimum VIABLE (not minimum)
  - Validated learning (evidence of real customer behavior)
  - Pivot or persevere (data-driven, not faith)
  - Innovation accounting: Pick ONE metric that matters
  
- **Four Steps to the Epiphany (Steve Blank)**
  - Customer Development > Product Development
  - Get out of the building (talk to users)
  - Search (find model) → Execute (scale model)
  - No business plan survives first contact
  
- **Innovator's Dilemma (Clayton Christensen)**
  - Disruptive innovation starts low-end or new market
  - Incumbents can't respond (conflicts with existing model)
  - Good management kills disruptive innovation
  - Create separate unit with different metrics

**Action:** Customer Development first (10 convos before building) → MVP (smallest thing to test hypothesis) → ONE metric to validate → Build-Measure-Learn → Pivot or persevere.

## 6. MANAGING AI AGENTS

**Situation:** Delegating to AI, improving outputs, structuring prompts, agent workflows

**Models:**
- **Situational Leadership (Hersey-Blanchard)**
  - D1 (low skill, high will) → Directing: Tell exactly what to do
  - D2 (some skill, low will) → Coaching: Explain why + how
  - D3 (high skill, variable will) → Supporting: Ask questions, facilitate
  - D4 (high skill, high will) → Delegating: Set goal, step back
  
- **DECO Framework (Direction, Examples, Constraints, Output)**
  - Direction: What's the goal/task?
  - Examples: Show 2-3 samples of what good looks like
  - Constraints: What NOT to do, limits, rules
  - Output: Exact format expected
  
- **Trust Curve**
  - Start small (test on non-critical)
  - Validate output (check early work)
  - Increase scope gradually
  - Calibrate on errors (what did it miss?)
  - Full delegation at high consistency

**Action:** Start with DECO (clear direction + examples + constraints) → Situational leadership (match to agent capability) → Trust Curve (small → validate → scale).

---

## 7. QUALITY ISSUES

**Situation:** Mistakes repeating, inconsistent output, errors slipping through, broken process

**Models:**
- **Deming (Quality Management)**
  - Variation = enemy (special vs common cause)
  - Process, not people (95% of problems are system)
  - PDCA: Plan, Do, Check, Act (continuous improvement)
  - Eliminate inspection by building quality in
  
- **Checklist Manifesto (Atul Gawande)**
  - DO-CONFIRM (do from memory, check after)
  - READ-DO (step-by-step, check as you go)
  - 5-9 items per list (cognitive load limit)
  - Checklists for complexity + high stakes
  - Pause points (where to stop and check)
  
- **Jidoka (Toyota Production System)**
  - "Automation with a human touch"
  - Stop the line when defect detected
  - Andon cord: Anyone can halt production
  - Build quality into process (poka-yoke = error-proofing)
  - Separate human from machine work

**Action:** Find if variation is special cause (one-off) or common cause (systemic) → Build checklist for critical steps → Design error-proofing (make mistakes impossible) → Measure defect rate → PDCA to improve.

---

## 8. STRATEGIC PLANNING

**Situation:** Annual planning, new initiative, evaluating options, portfolio decisions

**Models:**
- **MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)**
  - Break problem into parts that don't overlap + cover everything
  - Tests: "Is there a gap?" "Is there overlap?"
  - Forces complete thinking
  - McKinsey's foundational tool
  
- **ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses, CIA)**
  - List all hypotheses (don't anchor on one)
  - List evidence for EACH
  - Rate diagnosticity: Does this evidence discriminate between hypotheses?
  - Reject hypotheses (disconfirm vs confirm)
  - Least bad hypothesis wins (not most supported)
  
- **Pre-mortem (Gary Klein)**
  - "It's 1 year from now. This failed spectacularly. Why?"
  - Forces team to imagine failure (permission to dissent)
  - Surfaces hidden concerns
  - Identifies weak points before committing

**Action:** MECE decomposition (break into non-overlapping parts) → ACH (list competing options, evaluate evidence) → Pre-mortem (assume each option fails, why?) → Decide.

**How to Use This:**
1. Find your situation above
2. Read the 2-3 models
3. Apply the Action line
4. If still stuck, read the full book/framework

**Principle:** Don't reinvent. Use the model that's already solved this.
