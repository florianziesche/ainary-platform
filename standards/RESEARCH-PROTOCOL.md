**Pre-Research Protocol → Structured Investigation → BLUF Output**

## Phase 1: Pre-Research (BEFORE searching anything)

### 1. Frame the Question
**What exactly am I trying to answer?**
- Write it as a single, clear question
- If compound, break into sub-questions

### 2. State Your Hypothesis
**What do I expect to find?**
- Forces you to be explicit about priors
- Enables deliberate disconfirmation later
- Example: "I expect X because Y"

### 3. MECE Decomposition
**What are ALL the pieces I need to answer this?**
- Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
- Break question into 3-7 sub-components
- Test: Do these cover everything? Do they overlap?

### 4. Define Stopping Criteria
**When am I done?**
- ✅ **Saturation rule:** 3 consecutive sources with NO new info = STOP
- ✅ **Confidence threshold:** Stop when you can assign 75%+ confidence
- ✅ **Time box:** Max [X] minutes (set upfront)
- ⚠️ **Red flag:** If you're still finding new stuff after 10+ sources, question is too broad

### 5. Source Plan
**Where will I look, in what order?**
1. Primary sources first (original data, company docs, research papers)
2. Secondary synthesis (analysis, commentary)
3. Tertiary only if needed (summaries, wikis)

## Phase 2: Research Execution

### Admiralty Source Rating (Simplified)
Rate EVERY source you use:

**Reliability (Source quality):**
- **A** = Primary source, verified, authoritative (company filing, academic paper, official data)
- **B** = Reputable secondary (major news, established analysis, known expert)
- **C** = Unverified, opinion, anonymous, or questionable (blog, forum, tweet)

**Credibility (This specific claim):**
- **1** = Confirmed by multiple sources, direct evidence
- **2** = Plausible, some evidence, fits pattern
- **3** = Rumor, speculation, or unverified

**Grade each source:** A1 (best) → C3 (worst)
**Flag anything below B2.** Use only to generate hypotheses, not conclusions.

### Deliberate Disconfirmation
**After initial research, ACTIVELY SEEK evidence you're wrong:**
- "What would disprove this?"
- Search for counter-arguments
- Check opposing perspectives
- If you can't find ANY disconfirming evidence, you're probably in an echo chamber

### Saturation Tracking
Keep a simple tally:
- Source 8: ✅ New info
- Source 9: ❌ Nothing new
- Source 10: ❌ Nothing new  
- Source 11: ❌ Nothing new → **STOP**

## Phase 3: Post-Research Output (BLUF Format)

### BLUF = Bottom Line Up Front
**Structure every research output this way:**

#### 1. THE ANSWER (2-3 sentences max)
The direct answer to the original question. No preamble.

#### 2. CONFIDENCE LEVEL
- **Almost Certainly (95%+):** Multiple A1/A2 sources, cross-verified
- **Likely (75-85%):** Strong B1/B2 sources, consistent pattern
- **Possibly (50-60%):** Limited sources, some contradictions
- **Unlikely (15-25%):** Weak sources, significant uncertainty
- **Unknown (<15%):** Insufficient data

#### 3. KEY EVIDENCE (3-5 bullet points)
- Most important facts supporting the answer
- **[Source: A1/B2/etc.]** after each claim
- Lead with strongest evidence

#### 4. GAPS & UNCERTAINTIES
**What's missing or unclear?**
- What you couldn't verify
- Where sources disagreed
- What would increase confidence

#### 5. SOURCES (Appendix)

## Post-Delivery Checklist

Before sending ANY research output:

- [ ] Did I answer the EXACT question asked?
- [ ] Is my BLUF actually 2-3 sentences (not a paragraph)?
- [ ] Did I rate ALL sources using Admiralty system?
- [ ] Did I actively search for disconfirming evidence?
- [ ] Did I hit saturation (3 consecutive no-new-info sources)?
- [ ] Did I state confidence level with reasoning?
- [ ] Did I flag gaps and uncertainties?
- [ ] Can someone verify my work by checking my sources?

---

## Red Flags (Stop & Recalibrate)

- ⚠️ **All sources agree perfectly** → Echo chamber, search harder for dissent
- ⚠️ **10+ sources, still finding new info** → Question too broad, narrow it
- ⚠️ **Can't assign confidence level** → Evidence too weak, say "Unknown"
- ⚠️ **No primary sources** → You're reading summaries of summaries, go deeper
- ⚠️ **Can't write 2-sentence BLUF** → You don't understand it well enough yet

---

**Remember:** Research isn't about reading everything. It's about finding the truth efficiently, knowing when to stop, and communicating clearly.

**Default mode:** Start timer, decompose question, search until saturation, write BLUF, ship it.
