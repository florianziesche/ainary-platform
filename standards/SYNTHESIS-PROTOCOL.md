# SYNTHESIS-PROTOCOL.md
**From Data → Insight → Recommendation**

---

## Core Principle
**Synthesis isn't summarization.** It's connecting dots others miss, then testing if those connections are real.

---

## Structure: SCQA Framework

Every synthesis output follows this flow:

### **S = SITUATION**
What's the context? What's known and stable?
- 1-2 sentences
- Sets the stage without drama
- Example: "Florian is applying to VC roles. He has operator experience but limited investing track record."

### **C = COMPLICATION**
What changed? What's the tension or problem?
- 1-2 sentences
- The thing that makes this worth thinking about
- Example: "Most funds want 2+ years of investing experience, which he doesn't have."

### **Q = QUESTION**
What are we trying to figure out?
- 1 sentence, crystal clear
- Example: "How can he position his operator background as an asset rather than a gap?"

### **A = ANSWER**
Your synthesized insight + recommendation
- 2-3 sentences: the SO WHAT
- Then supporting evidence and reasoning
- Example: "Position as 'operator-investor hybrid' — rare in early-stage VC. Funds struggle to evaluate companies pre-PMF; operators have pattern recognition investors lack. Lean into this as differentiation, not apologize for the gap."

## Quality Gate: The Insight Ladder

Grade your output BEFORE shipping. **Anything below Level 3 = don't send it.**

### **Level 0: Raw Data**
"Here's what I found." (Not synthesis, just reporting.)

### **Level 1: Summary**
"Here are the key points." (Organization, no insight.)

### **Level 2: Comparison**
"Here's how X differs from Y." (Observes patterns, no interpretation.)

### **🚨 Level 3: INSIGHT (Minimum bar)**
"Here's what this MEANS." (Explains why it matters.)
**Required elements:**
- Non-obvious connection between data points
- Explains causation or implication
- Changes understanding

### **Level 4: Recommendation**
"Here's what to DO about it." (Insight + clear action.)

### **Level 5: Strategic Foresight**
"Here's what happens next if you do/don't act." (Second-order effects.)

**Your default target:** Level 4 (Insight + Recommendation)

## Pre-Mortem: Assume You're Wrong

**Before finalizing ANY synthesis, run this:**

> "Assume this analysis is completely wrong. What are the 3 most likely reasons?"

**Common failure modes:**
1. **Confirmation bias** — Only saw evidence supporting my hypothesis
2. **Correlation ≠ causation** — Two things happen together ≠ one causes the other
3. **Small sample size** — Pattern from 3 data points isn't a pattern
4. **Recency bias** — Weighted recent events too heavily
5. **Survivor bias** — Only looked at successes, ignored failures
6. **Anchoring** — First thing I read shaped everything after

**If you can't articulate 2-3 plausible ways you're wrong, you haven't thought hard enough.**

## Calibrated Confidence Language

**Use EXACT phrases to communicate uncertainty:**

| Confidence | Phrase | When to Use |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **95%+** | "Almost certainly" | Multiple strong sources, clear pattern, low ambiguity |
| **75-85%** | "Likely" | Good evidence, some gaps, reasonable assumptions |
| **50-60%** | "Possibly" | Mixed evidence, significant uncertainty |
| **15-25%** | "Unlikely" | Weak evidence, contradictions |
| **<15%** | "Unknown" or "Insufficient data" | Can't form a reliable view |

**Never say:**
- ❌ "Probably" (too vague)
- ❌ "Maybe" (meaningless)
- ❌ "I think" (confidence = ?)
- ❌ "It seems" (weasel words)

**Always say:**
- ✅ "Likely (75%) based on X, Y, Z evidence"
- ✅ "Almost certainly (95%), verified across A, B, C sources"

---

## "So What?" Three-Layer Test

**Test every piece of your synthesis:**

### **Layer 1: Interesting?**
"So what? Why should anyone care?"
If you can't answer → cut it.

### **Layer 2: Actionable?**
"So what? What should someone do with this?"
If it doesn't change behavior or decisions → rethink it.

### **Layer 3: Durable?**
"So what? Does this matter in 6 months?"
If it's just noise or will be irrelevant soon → flag it as tactical, not strategic.

**Example:**
- ❌ **Fails Layer 1:** "VCs raised a lot of money in 2021" (everyone knows)
- ✅ **Passes all 3:** "VCs overfunded in 2021 → now have 'zombie' portfolios dragging returns → hiring freezes through 2026 → **SO WHAT:** apply to funds that raised 2023+, they're still deploying"

## Synthesis Checklist

Before delivering ANY synthesis:

- [ ] **SCQA complete?** (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)
- [ ] **Insight Level 3+?** (Not just summary, actual insight with "why this matters")
- [ ] **Pre-mortem done?** (Listed 3 ways I could be wrong)
- [ ] **Confidence calibrated?** (Used exact phrases: almost certainly/likely/possibly/unlikely)
- [ ] **"So What?" at every layer?** (Interesting? Actionable? Durable?)
- [ ] **Evidence cited?** (Can someone verify my logic?)
- [ ] **Recommendation clear?** (If someone reads only the Answer, they know what to do)

## Common Synthesis Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Info dump** | "Here's everything I learned" | Apply SCQA, cut to insight |
| **Obvious answer** | "It depends" or "There are pros and cons" | Force a recommendation with confidence level |
| **Buried lede** | Key insight in paragraph 4 | BLUF / SCQA — answer first |
| **No action** | Ends with "Interesting findings..." | Always end with "Therefore, do X" |
| **False precision** | "63% likely" from gut feel | Use calibrated phrases, admit uncertainty |
| **Hedging** | "Maybe X, but also Y, though Z" | Pick the MOST LIKELY, state confidence, note alternatives |
