## Application Strategy

### Where to Apply
**Direct:** jobs.ashbyhq.com/primary (mentioned on team page)

### Who to Know
1. **Investment team:** Zach Fredericks (Principal), Tanmaye Bhatia (Sr. Associate)
2. **Partners:** Emily Man, Tobias Citron (newer partners, may be more accessible)
3. **GPs:** Ben Sun (if warm intro available)

### What to Emphasize
1. **Builder DNA** — "I'm not a banker who decided to try VC. I built, raised, sold to enterprise."
2. **AI depth** — Specific technical expertise (RAG, agents, hallucination mitigation)
3. **Operator skills** — Can actually help portfolio companies (hiring, GTM, product)
4. **NYC native** — Local, can be in office

### Cover Letter Angle
> "When I read 'builders, not just backers,' I felt like Primary was describing how I want to work. After 5 years as a founder, I know that what early-stage companies need isn't advice — it's someone who rolls up their sleeves. I want to be that person for your portfolio."

### Differentiation
- Don't just talk about "AI interest" — show you've built AI systems
- Reference their AI portfolio (Cake.ai, Etched, Circuit & Chisel)
- Emphasize operator skills that match their "Primary Impact" team
