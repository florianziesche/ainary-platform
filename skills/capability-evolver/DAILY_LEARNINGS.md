# Daily Learnings — Self-Improvement Research

## 2026-02-12

### OpenClaw Updates (v2026.2.9 — Latest Release)
- **iOS Node App (Alpha):** Device pairing now available on iOS — could pair Florian's iPhone for camera/location/notifications
- **Grok as web_search provider:** xAI's Grok now available as alternative search backend
- **Agent Management via Web UI:** agents.create/update/delete RPCs — multi-agent setups easier to manage
- **BlueBubbles channel cleanup:** Better iMessage integration path
- **Compaction divider in Web UI:** Easier to see where context was compacted
- **OPENCLAW_HOME env var:** Can override home directory for path resolution

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Consider iOS node pairing when Florian has time (camera snap, location, notifications on phone)
- [ ] Test Grok as search provider for comparison

### AI Agent Patterns (Feb 2026 Trends)
- **Agentic AI market:** $5.2B (2024) → projected $200B by 2034
- **Key shift:** From chatbots to autonomous multi-step execution agents
- **n8n + AI agents:** Gaining traction for enterprise workflow automation (HR, finance, comms)
- **Stack AI:** Enterprise data agents with self-hosting option
- **Pattern:** "Middle-office automation" — AI managing long-running multi-step processes autonomously

### ClawHub
- Site live at clawhub.ai but minimal content visible via fetch. Check manually later.

### Workflow Analysis (Last 24h)
- Running on Opus model — good for complex tasks but expensive for routine work
- Cron jobs functioning well (this research session proves it)
- No critical failures in recent sessions

### Practical Improvements to Implement
1. **iOS Node Pairing** — Would enable phone notifications, camera access, location
2. **Search Provider Diversity** — Could add Grok for certain research tasks
3. **Agent Management** — Web UI now supports CRUD for agents, simplifying multi-agent setups
