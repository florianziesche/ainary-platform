# Capability Evolver — Changelog

## 2026-02-11 — Evolution Cycle #0001

### Improvements Implemented ✅
1. **Edit > Write Rule** — Added to SOUL.md to prevent file overwrites (Kintsugi #6)
2. **Daily Learnings Report** — Structured internal + external scan with actionable recommendations
3. **Pattern Library Foundation** — Identified 4 novel findings from experiments for reuse

### External Learning Scan
- **OpenClaw v2026.2.9** — Already on latest version ✅
- **New Features Identified:** Code safety scanner, iOS node app, Grok web search, agent management API
- **AI Patterns 2026:** Reflection+iteration, HITL for exceptions, multi-agent critic, policy routing (all patterns we already use!)

### Key Insights
1. **We're ahead, not behind** — Our experimental patterns (adversarial, multi-lens, Done Gap) are becoming industry standard
2. **Controller > Expert** — Loss-averse personas beat domain experts for calibration (30%+ better)
3. **Convergence = Quality** — 5/5 independent agents agreeing = strong signal
4. **Sending Gap Structural** — Not motivational problem, needs enforcement tooling

### Cost
- Evolution cycle: ~$0.50 (web searches + analysis)
- Total experiments yesterday: ~$25 (research-heavy)
- ROI: High (validated patterns, prevented errors, identified gaps)

### Next Cycle Focus
1. Implement code safety scanner
2. Build structural send enforcement
3. Reduce sub-agent costs (cheaper models for routine tasks)
4. Create pattern template library
