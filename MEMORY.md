## Florian — Key Context

- Former startup CEO (36ZERO Vision, cloud computer vision, Munich)
- Raised €5.5M+ (€4M equity, €1.5M grants) across multiple rounds
- Currently in Schlottwitz, Germany (parents' house) — moved for ALG1 + lower costs
- Home base: NYC (550 10th Ave, lottery housing + Section 8)
- German native, English for work

### Family
- **Wife:** Nancy — NYC-based freelancer (massage, caregiving, building PA/marketing business)
- **Daughter:** Floriana — 3 years old (birthday Dec 25, 2022), currently in German kindergarten
- Floriana is his primary source of happiness
- Protected time: 18:00-20:30 daily (quality time with daughter)

### Financial Reality (as of Feb 2026)
- **Target:** €6K/month to breathe easy
- **Minimum:** €3K/month
- **ALG 1:** ~€2,700/month (applying soon)
- **Debt:** ~€70K (parents, KfW, Finanzamt, health insurance)
- NYC rent: ~$1,300/month (after discounts)

## Working With Florian

- Direct communication, no fluff
- Hates: pleasantries, sugarcoating, busywork
- Push him when: procrastinating on outreach, building instead of shipping
- Loves: systems thinking, physics mental models, leverage
- Weakness: "Can overthink/overbuild systems before shipping"
- **Key instruction:** Question every task — is this really the best approach?

### Productivity Schedule
- Peak: 8:30-17:30 (when Floriana at Kita), mornings best
- Evening: 22:00-24:00 (~2h)
- Weekends: ~3h evening
- Do not disturb: 18:00-20:30

## Current Priorities (as of 2026-02-01)

1. VC career transition — land associate role at AI-focused fund
2. Ainary Ventures — building his own fund (long-term)
3. Content engine — blog, Notion templates, courses
4. Systems — make everything compound

## Active Threads

- **VC Lab Sprint 2** — Due Feb 4, 7/8 deliverables drafted, Step 5 (Secret Sauce) needs Florian's examples
- **Monique Barbanson meeting** — Feb 3, 6 PM CET — Full prep ready (meeting brief, demo script, day-of checklist)
- **Decile Capital application** — Cover letter ready, submit Monday Feb 3 (after Monique meeting)
- **LinkedIn Post** — "Founder to VC" post ready for Feb 3, 14:00 CET (strategic timing: before Monique meeting)
- **Maschinenbau Schlottwitz** — CNC demo ready, uncle is warm lead, fastest path to revenue
- **CNC Planner Pro** — Mehrere Versionen existieren (v2, v3, v4). v4 = Enhanced Fertigungsanweisung mit Progress Bar, Material-Warnungen, Werkzeug-Standzeitbalken, etc. Alle in `projects/cnc-planner/`
- **Knowledge System** — 10 RSS feeds active, 144 articles captured, blogwatcher running

## CNC Planner Status (Quick Reference)

- **Location:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/projects/cnc-planner/`
- **Versionen:** v2 (PDF/STEP upload), v3 (verbessert), v4 (Enhanced FA mit Checklisten)
- **Pricing:** Pro €49/mo, Business €149/mo
- **Target:** Onkel als erster Pilot → €750/Monat recurring
- **Related files:** `products/cnc-planner/PRICING.md`, `ROI-CALCULATOR.md`

## Key People

- **Monique Barbanson** — Entelechy Ventures, AI-native B2B investor, Yale CS/AI, 20yr enterprise data/AI (Microsoft, Affirm), patents holder, founded Startup Monthly (Lean Startup accelerator). Meeting Feb 3 — she saw Florian's WhatsApp AI in VC Lab, curious about his workflow. Technical, operator background, values iteration.
- **Conor** — Venture Institute, intro to NYC VC network
- **Yashodhana** — VC Lab peer, NYC event organizer
- **Daniel** — Networking contact, virtual coffee opportunity

## Target Funds (Operator-Friendly)

- HOF Capital — explicitly seeks founder + AI/ML experience
- Primary Venture Partners — NYC seed-stage, values operators
- Betaworks — AI/consumer, invested in HuggingFace

## Technical Differentiator

Legal AI Platform with <0.2% hallucination rate using:
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense semantic)
- Cross-encoder re-ranking
- Multi-agent verification (Questioner → Researcher → Validator → Reporter)

## Core Frameworks

- **Compound Knowledge:** Capture → Connect → Compound → Better Outputs → Repeat
- **Tool Decision Test:** "Does this create or strengthen a feedback loop?"
- **Expert Archivist:** Legal AI = veracity and traceability, not creative oracle
- **WHO-WHAT-WHY-HOW:** Structure prompts for better outputs

## Lessons Learned

- Founder-to-employee transition is legitimately hard — normal, not failure
- Treat job search like a sales pipeline — track applied → responded → interviewing
- Add one specific detail when complimenting content — generic praise is invisible
- Write for retrieval, not storage — vague notes = vague AI outputs
- Push back on building instead of shipping — his stated weakness
- **LinkedIn timing matters** — Post content strategically (e.g., before important meetings for conversation starters)
- **Brave API key missing** — Web search unavailable until configured (`openclaw configure --section web`)
- **Obsidian + OpenClaw sync** — Keep heavy research in Obsidian, operations in workspace, avoid duplication
- **ACTIVE_TASK.md** — Neue Datei für laufende Aufgaben. Überlebt Context-Kompaktierung. Bei neuer Aufgabe: erst dokumentieren, dann arbeiten. (Added 2026-02-02)
- **Keine "mental notes"** — Alles Wichtige sofort in Datei schreiben. Memory ist begrenzt, Dateien überleben. (Added 2026-02-02)

## Content Pillars

1. AI & Work — managing AI agents as employees
2. AI & Founders — building companies with AI leverage
3. AI & Systems — Notion, automation, compound knowledge
4. AI & Careers — positioning for AI transition
