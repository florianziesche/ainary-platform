I build AI that replaces workflows, not tasks.

AI Consultant · Builder · VC Lab Fellow

I like to work on the edge of tech, apply it, and use it 
to build leverage. I work with startups because I see 
enormous potential to literally help them and companies 
get incredibly successful — especially right now, with 
tech advancing this fast.

The best time to start was yesterday.

## 3 BIGGEST PROBLEMS (AI-First Solutions)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OPTION A: Problem → Solution Format
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. EXPERTISE TRAPPED IN PEOPLE
   Master craftsmen retire. Domain knowledge vanishes. 
   AI-first: Capture, structure, deploy — before it's gone.

2. MANUAL WORK THAT SCALES LINEARLY
   Your best people doing repetitive cognitive tasks.
   AI-first: Workflows that compound, not headcount.

3. SLOW ITERATION IN HIGH-STAKES ENVIRONMENTS
   Legal, manufacturing, compliance — "move fast" isn't allowed.
   AI-first: Speed + reliability through multi-agent validation.


OPTION B: Direct Statement Format
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Three problems AI-first companies solve right now:

▪ Expertise locked in people (not systems)
▪ Cognitive work that scales with headcount (not leverage)
▪ Speed vs. reliability false choice (multi-agent systems solve both)


OPTION C: Question Format
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What problems can AI-first solve right now?

Your master machinist retires next year. Can you 
clone their expertise before they're gone?

Your team spends 40% of their time on email, reports, 
and coordination. Can AI handle workflows, not just tasks?

You need speed and reliability — but current tools 
force you to choose one. What if you could have both?
