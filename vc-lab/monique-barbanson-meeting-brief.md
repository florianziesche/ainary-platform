## What Makes Her Tick

- **Deeply technical** — Yale CS/AI, holds patents, not a finance-first VC
- **Operator background** — Built products at Microsoft, understands the trenches
- **Lean Startup DNA** — Taught customer discovery to founders, values iteration over perfection
- **AI thesis** — Invests in AI-native B2B, data infrastructure, applied AI
- **Languages** — Check LinkedIn for details (likely multilingual given background)

## Why She's Interested

She saw your GPT on WhatsApp in VC Lab. That's unusual — most people *talk* about AI, you *live* in it. She wants to see the behind-the-scenes of how you actually work.

---

## Meeting Strategy

### The Frame

This is NOT a pitch meeting. It's a **"show your thinking"** session. She's curious about your AI workflow. That's your superpower — the compound system you've built.

**Primary Goal:** Impress her with *how* you work, not *what* you've built.  
**Secondary Goal:** Build relationship, understand her investment thesis better.  
**Tertiary:** Legal AI Platform can come up naturally if relevant — don't force it.

---

## What to Show Her

### 1. The Stack (2-3 min overview)
- OpenClaw/Atlas as the orchestration layer
- How memory compounds across sessions (show MEMORY.md concept)
- Notion + Obsidian integration (public vs private brain)
- Multi-channel access (WhatsApp, Telegram, web)
- Sub-agents for specialized tasks (HUNTER, RESEARCHER, etc.)

### 2. Live Demo: A Real Workflow (5-7 min)

**Option A: Research Task**
- "Atlas, research [fund X]" 
- Show how it pulls data, structures it, saves to memory
- Demonstrate the compound effect — next time you ask, context is retained

**Option B: Content Creation**
- Show how a blog post goes from idea → outline → draft → social variants
- Demonstrate the WRITER agent handoff

**Option C: Job Search Support** (most relevant to VC Lab context)
- How you prep interview briefs
- Pipeline tracking
- Follow-up automation

**Recommendation:** Option A or C — both showcase research + memory, which she'll appreciate as technical.

### 3. The Philosophy (conversation)
- Why you built this: 100x leverage, compound advantage
- How it changes how you work vs. "just using ChatGPT"
- What's still broken / where it's heading
- The "AI-native workflow" as a competitive moat

## Talking Points Aligned to Her Interests

| Her Interest | Your Angle |
|--------------|------------|
| AI-native B2B | You're building an AI-native workflow for yourself — same principles apply to products |
| Technical depth | You can go deep on RAG, agent architectures, memory systems, prompt engineering |
| Lean Startup | Your system is iterative — you ship, learn, compound. Daily notes = learning loops. |
| Data infrastructure | Your workspace IS a personal data layer — Notion, Obsidian, memory files, structured context |
| Enterprise AI (her career) | Discuss parallels between personal AI systems and enterprise deployment challenges |

---

## Questions to Ask Her

1. "What patterns are you seeing in the AI-native B2B deals you're evaluating?"
2. "What separates the best AI founders you've backed from the rest?"
3. "How do you think about AI tooling for VC workflows specifically?"
4. "What's your thesis on where applied AI creates the most value in enterprise?"
5. "Given your Microsoft/Affirm background — what do enterprises still get wrong about AI adoption?"
6. "What made you transition from operator to investor?"

## Potential Outcomes

| Outcome | Signal | Follow-up |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Best** | She's impressed, offers intros to portfolio companies or other VCs | Send thank you + specific ask |
| **Good** | She shares insights on AI investing, engages deeply | Nurture relationship, stay in touch |
| **Bonus** | She asks about Legal AI Platform | She sees deal potential — offer more details |
| **Baseline** | Pleasant conversation, no clear next step | Follow up with valuable content, stay warm |

---

## Logistics

- **Platform:** TBD (confirm with Monique — Zoom? Google Meet?)
- **Duration:** Probably 30-45 min (confirm)
- **Prep:** Have OpenClaw running, workspace visible, demo ready
- **Backup:** If tech fails, have screenshots/screen recording ready

---

## Pre-Meeting Checklist

- [ ] Confirm meeting platform and link
- [ ] Test OpenClaw demo flow
- [ ] Have specific research example ready (pick a fund to research live)
- [ ] Review her recent LinkedIn posts for conversation starters
- [ ] Prepare 1-pager on Legal AI Platform (just in case)
