## Event Strategy

### Before Each Event

1. **Research attendees** — Who's going? Any warm intros possible?
2. **Set a goal** — "Meet 3 people I'll follow up with" > "network"
3. **Prepare your intro** — Crisp, memorable, thesis-aligned
4. **Bring cards** — Or have LinkedIn QR code ready

### Your 30-Second Intro (Draft)

> "I'm Florian — I was a startup CEO for 5 years, raised over 5 million in Germany, and now I'm transitioning to VC. I focus on AI-native B2B companies because I built products in that space and can actually evaluate the tech. Currently doing VC Lab with Decile."

### At the Event

1. **Quality > Quantity** — 3 good conversations beat 20 card swaps
2. **Ask questions** — "What are you working on?" > talking about yourself
3. **Find connectors** — Who knows everyone? Befriend them.
4. **Take notes** — Immediately after, jot down who you met and follow-up actions

### Within 24 Hours

1. **Connect on LinkedIn** with personalized note
2. **Send follow-up email** if deeper conversation
3. **Add to CRM/tracker** (Notion, Decile Hub)

## Other Event Sources to Check

- **VC Lab Slack** — Cohort meetups, alumni events
- **Tech:NYC** — NYC tech ecosystem events
- **On Deck** — If you have access
- **Founder Slack communities** — Often share events
- **Fund-specific events** — Check portfolio company launches, demo days

## Note: Feb 3 Conflict

The PE/VC/Fintech Mixer is Monday Feb 3 at 6 PM — **same time as Monique meeting** (also 6 PM CET, which is 12 PM NYC). 

Actually wait — Monique is 6 PM CET = 12 PM NYC. So you could do both:
- 12 PM NYC: Monique meeting
- 6 PM NYC: PE/VC/Fintech Mixer

Could be a power day if you're up for it.
