## Core VC Terms

### Fund Structure

**General Partner (GP)**  
The individual(s) who manage a venture fund. GPs make investment decisions, source deals, and support portfolio companies. They typically invest 1-2% of fund capital (GP commit) and earn management fees + carried interest.

**Limited Partner (LP)**  
Investors who provide capital to a venture fund but don't participate in day-to-day management. LPs include pension funds, endowments, family offices, fund-of-funds, and high-net-worth individuals. They receive returns after GP carry.

**Management Fee**  
Annual fee paid to GPs for fund operations, typically 2% of committed capital during investment period, then 2% of invested capital. Covers salaries, office, travel, and operational costs.

**Carried Interest (Carry)**  
GP's share of fund profits, typically 20% after returning LP capital + preferred return. This is the primary economic incentive for GPs to generate strong returns.

**Preferred Return (Hurdle Rate)**  
Minimum annual return LPs must receive before GPs earn carry, typically 8%. Ensures LPs get baseline returns before profit sharing kicks in.

### Investment Terms

**Pre-Money Valuation**  
Company valuation before new investment. If pre-money is $10M and you invest $2M, post-money is $12M and you own 16.7% ($2M / $12M).

**Post-Money Valuation**  
Company valuation after investment is added. Post-money = Pre-money + Investment Amount.

**Pro-Rata Rights**  
Right to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership percentage. If you own 10% and company raises again, pro-rata lets you invest enough to stay at 10%.

**Liquidation Preference**  
Determines payout order in exit/liquidation. "1x non-participating" means investors get their money back first (1x), then remaining proceeds go to common shareholders. "Participating" means investors get 1x back AND share in remaining proceeds.

**Anti-Dilution Protection**  
Protects investors if company raises at lower valuation (down round). Weighted average anti-dilution adjusts conversion price based on how much was raised and at what price.

### Deal Flow & Process

**Deal Flow**  
Pipeline of investment opportunities. Quality deal flow comes from: network referrals, accelerators, cold outreach, content/brand, and other investors.

**Due Diligence**  
Investigation before investment. Covers: team background, market size, product/tech, financials, legal, customer references, and competitive landscape.

**Term Sheet**  
Non-binding document outlining key investment terms: valuation, amount, board seats, protective provisions, etc. Precedes definitive legal documents.

**Cap Table**  
Spreadsheet showing company ownership: who owns what percentage, including founders, employees (options), and investors across all rounds.

### Return Metrics

**TVPI (Total Value to Paid-In)**  
Total fund value (realized + unrealized) divided by capital called. TVPI of 2.0x means fund is worth 2x what LPs have invested.

**DPI (Distributions to Paid-In)**  
Cash returned to LPs divided by capital called. DPI shows actual realized returns (money back in LP pockets).

**IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**  
Annualized return accounting for timing of cash flows. A 25% IRR over 10 years is strong. IRR can be gamed by quick early exits.

**MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital)**  
Simple multiple: total value / invested capital. Doesn't account for time. 3x MOIC in 3 years is much better than 3x in 10 years.

**Seed**

**Series A**  
First major institutional round. Typically $5-15M. Company has PMF, meaningful revenue, scaling go-to-market. Led by traditional VCs with board seat.

**Series B+**  
Growth rounds. Scaling proven model. Larger check sizes, often led by growth equity firms. Less about product risk, more about execution risk.

## NYC-Specific Terms

**Emerging Manager**  
Fund manager on Fund I, II, or III. Often smaller fund sizes, less track record, but potentially higher returns due to agility and hunger.

**Fund-of-Funds (FoF)**  
LP that invests in multiple VC funds rather than directly in companies. Provides diversification. Examples: Cendana, Industry Ventures, Greenspring.

**Anchor LP**  
First major LP to commit to a fund, typically 20-30% of target. Gives credibility for subsequent fundraising.
