## How VCs Source Deals: The Funnel

### Overview

VCs typically see 1,000+ companies per year to make 5-15 investments. Sourcing is the top of this funnel — and it's highly competitive. The best deals are often won before they hit the market.

---

## Primary Sourcing Channels

### 1. Warm Referrals (60-70% of deals)

The dominant source. Referrals come from:
- **Portfolio founders** — Your existing investments refer new deals
- **Other VCs** — Syndication, passing on deals outside their thesis
- **Angel investors** — Often see deals first, bring in VCs
- **Accelerators/incubators** — Y Combinator, Techstars, ERA
- **Service providers** — Lawyers, accountants, recruiters who work with startups

**Why it works:** Trust is pre-established. VC's time is limited — referrals filter signal from noise.

**How to build this:** Be helpful. Add value before asking for anything. The best VCs are known as "founder-friendly."

---

### 2. Proactive Outreach (15-25% of deals)

VCs going to founders, not the other way around.

**Tactics:**
- **Thesis-driven research** — Map a sector, identify all relevant companies, reach out to best ones
- **Twitter/LinkedIn presence** — Content attracts founders who want to work with you
- **Events and conferences** — Meet founders before they're fundraising
- **Cold outreach** — Personalized, thesis-relevant messages (low hit rate but can find hidden gems)

**Why it matters:** The best companies often don't need to fundraise traditionally. Proactive sourcing finds them first.

---

### 3. Inbound (10-15% of deals)

Founders approaching the fund directly.

**Channels:**
- Fund website contact forms
- Social media DMs
- Cold emails
- Accelerator demo days
- Pitch competitions

**The challenge:** High volume, low signal. Most inbound is not fundable. But occasionally a gem slips through.

**How to improve inbound quality:** Build brand around specific thesis so the right founders self-select.

---

### 4. Proprietary Networks

**What this means:**
- University programs (Stanford, MIT, etc.)
- Corporate partnerships (Microsoft for Startups, AWS portfolio)
- Scout networks (angels who get allocation for referring deals)
- LP networks (portfolio companies of your LPs)

**Example:** a16z has a formal scout program that paid deals to scouts for referrals.

## How This Applies to You (Florian)

As an aspiring VC, your sourcing edge comes from:

1. **Founder network** — Other founders from German/European ecosystem
2. **Technical credibility** — AI founders trust you understand their tech
3. **Content** — Blog + LinkedIn builds inbound from AI founders
4. **VC Lab network** — Co-invest opportunities with cohort
5. **Cross-border** — European AI deals that need US market help

**Action:** Start building your deal flow pipeline now, even before you have a fund. Track interesting companies. Build relationships before you need them.
