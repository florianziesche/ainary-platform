2. **Complete allocator list** — Research 3 more LPs backing emerging managers
3. **Add NYC-specific AI funds** — Find 5 more AI-focused investors in NYC
4. **Rate by relevance** — Which funds would be:
   - Good to work at? (job search)
   - Good to co-invest with? (Ainary future)
   - Good to network with? (VC Lab connections)
