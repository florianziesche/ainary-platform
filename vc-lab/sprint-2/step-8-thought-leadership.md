# Sprint 2, Step 8: Thought Leadership

**Requirement:** LinkedIn repost + engage with VC/startup content  
**Status:** ✅ Draft Ready

---

## Strategy

Thought leadership isn't about posting once — it's about being visible in the right conversations. The goal is to:
1. Signal expertise (AI + founder experience)
2. Be seen by VCs and founders you want to connect with
3. Build a body of work that compounds

## Quick Win: Repost + Commentary

Find a relevant post from a VC or thought leader and add your perspective. This gets you visibility without starting from scratch.

**Good sources to repost:**
- VC Lab / Decile team posts
- AI-focused VCs (Sarah Guo, Elad Gil, etc.)
- Founders sharing fundraising lessons
- AI product launches or takes

**Template for commentary:**

> [Repost + add]
> 
> This resonates. As a founder who raised €5.5M for an AI startup, [specific insight from your experience that relates to the original post].
> 
> [One additional thought or question]

## Original Post Ideas

### Idea 1: The AI-Native Operator Framework

> I've spent 5 years building AI products. Now I use AI to run my entire workflow.
> 
> Here's what most people get wrong about "using AI":
> 
> They treat it like a better search engine.
> 
> But AI-native isn't about asking questions — it's about building systems that compound.
> 
> My setup:
> - Memory that persists across sessions
> - Specialized agents for research, writing, deal flow
> - Automated follow-ups and briefings
> - Context that gets smarter every day
> 
> The gap between "using ChatGPT" and "AI-native workflow" is like the gap between sending emails and having a CRM.
> 
> What's one AI workflow that's changed how you work?

**Why this works:** Shows expertise, creates curiosity, invites engagement.

### Idea 2: Fundraising Lessons (Founder Perspective)

> I raised €5.5M for my AI startup. Here's what I wish I knew before my first investor meeting:
> 
> 1. **Investors talk to each other.** Your reputation compounds (good and bad).
> 
> 2. **The deck matters less than you think.** The story you tell matters more.
> 
> 3. **"We'll follow" means no.** Only leads matter.
> 
> 4. **Warm intros aren't optional.** Cold outreach has <5% response rate.
> 
> 5. **Due diligence is two-way.** Bad investors destroy more value than no investors.
> 
> What's the hardest fundraising lesson you've learned?

**Why this works:** Specific, credible (numbers), invites discussion.

### Idea 3: Why I'm Moving from Founder to VC

> After 5 years as a startup CEO, I'm transitioning to venture capital.
> 
> The question I keep getting: "Why?"
> 
> The honest answer:
> 
> I love the 0-1 phase. The strategy. The pattern recognition. The founder psychology.
> 
> But I realized I'd rather help 10 founders navigate the journey than do it once myself.
> 
> My edge: I've made the mistakes. Raised the rounds. Felt the pressure. I can spot the traps because I fell into them.
> 
> Looking forward to the next chapter — and connecting with other operators-turned-investors.
> 
> Anyone else made this transition? What surprised you most?

**Why this works:** Authentic, opens doors for connection, positions you for VC roles.

## Engagement Strategy

Don't just post — engage strategically on others' content:

**Daily habit (10-15 min):**
1. Comment on 2-3 posts from VCs or founders you want to know
2. Add genuine insight, not just "Great post!"
3. Ask thoughtful questions that show expertise

**People to engage with:**
- Decile / VC Lab team
- NYC-based AI investors
- Founders in AI space
- Other VC Lab participants

**Good comment formula:**
> [Relate to your experience] + [Add new insight or question]
> 
> "This matches what I saw at my startup — we [specific example]. One thing I'd add: [new angle or question]."
