## NYC Startup Funding Landscape

|--------|-----|-------------|-------|
| VC $ deployed (2024) | ~$30B+ | ~$60B+ | Gap narrowing |
| Unicorns | 100+ | 200+ | NYC catching up |
| Sector strength | Fintech, Media, Enterprise | Consumer, Deeptech | Differentiated |

**NYC's edge:** Proximity to finance (Wall Street), media (Madison Ave), enterprise buyers (Fortune 500 HQs).

## Later-Stage Trends in NYC

### Growth Capital Availability

NYC has no shortage of growth capital:
- **Tiger Global** — Massive deployment, fast decisions
- **Insight Partners** — 30+ year track record, enterprise focus
- **Coatue** — Crossover fund, public/private
- **General Atlantic** — Late stage, global

### The "Series A Crunch"

Pattern observed:
- Easy to raise pre-seed/seed
- Hard to close Series A (need real metrics)
- Those who do get strong Series B+ support

**Implication:** NYC has strong early and late capital — the gap is Series A (your potential focus).
