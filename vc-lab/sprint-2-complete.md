# Step 2: Investment Process — Sourcing Research

## How VCs Source Deals: The Funnel

VCs typically review 1,000+ companies per year to make 5–15 investments. Sourcing is the critical top-of-funnel — and in competitive markets, the best deals are won before they're publicly fundraising.

---

### Channel 1: Warm Referrals (60–70% of deals)

The dominant sourcing channel. Sources include:
- **Portfolio founders** — Existing investments refer new deals
- **Other VCs** — Syndication and passing on off-thesis deals
- **Angel investors** — Often see deals first, bring in institutional capital
- **Accelerators/incubators** — Y Combinator, Techstars, ERA demo days
- **Service providers** — Startup lawyers, accountants, recruiters

**Why it dominates:** Trust is pre-established. VCs' time is limited — referrals filter signal from noise.

**Ainary's approach:** Leverage founder network (200+ relationships from fundraising advisory and German ecosystem), VC Lab cohort, and cross-border European connections.

---

### Channel 2: Proactive Outreach (15–25% of deals)

VCs going to founders before they fundraise.

**Tactics:**
- **Thesis-driven research** — Map vertical AI sectors, identify all relevant companies, reach out to best ones
- **Content presence** — LinkedIn + blog attracts inbound from AI founders
- **Events and conferences** — Meet founders pre-fundraise
- **Cold outreach** — Personalized, thesis-relevant messages

**Ainary's approach:** Publish AI-native content on LinkedIn (establishes technical credibility), attend NYC AI events, proactively map Legal AI, Manufacturing AI, and Healthcare AI startups.

---

### Channel 3: Inbound (10–15% of deals)

**Channels:** Fund website, social media, cold emails, demo days, pitch competitions.

**Challenge:** High volume, low signal. But thesis-specific branding makes the right founders self-select.

**Ainary's approach:** Clear thesis branding (AI-native vertical software) ensures inbound is pre-qualified. Founders building in legal, manufacturing, or healthcare AI will know we "get it."

---

### Channel 4: Proprietary Networks

- **University programs** — NYC universities (Columbia, NYU, Cornell Tech)
- **Accelerator partnerships** — ERA, Techstars NYC
- **European bridge** — German/European AI founders entering US market
- **VC Lab alumni** — 600+ funds launched, strong co-invest network

---

# Step 3: Investment Stages — NYC Funding History

## NYC Startup Funding Landscape

### NYC vs. Silicon Valley

NYC has evolved from "second city" to a top-tier global tech hub:

| Metric | NYC | SF/Bay Area | Trend |
|--------|-----|-------------|-------|
| VC $ deployed (2024) | ~$33B | ~$65B | NYC at ~35% of national total |
| Unicorns | 100+ | 200+ | NYC catching up fast |
| Key sectors | Fintech, Enterprise, AI | Consumer, Deep tech | Differentiated strengths |
| Talent pipeline | Wall St, media, Fortune 500 | Stanford/Berkeley, tech incumbents | Both deep but different |

**NYC's structural advantage:** Proximity to enterprise buyers (Fortune 500 HQs), financial industry expertise (Wall Street), media ecosystem (Madison Ave), and massive diverse talent pool.

## The Series A Gap — Strategic Opportunity

Key pattern in NYC:
- **Easy to raise pre-seed/seed** — Abundant angel and seed capital
- **Hard to close Series A** — Requires real metrics, competition for few lead investors
- **Strong Series B+ support** — Growth capital abundant

**Implication for Ainary:** Investing at pre-seed/seed with strong post-investment support (helping founders reach Series A metrics) creates outsized value. Our operator experience directly addresses the execution gap.

# Step 4: VC Terminology Glossary

## Fund Structure Terms

**General Partner (GP):** The individual(s) who manage a venture fund. GPs make investment decisions, source deals, and support portfolio companies. They typically invest 1–2% of fund capital ("GP commit") and earn management fees + carried interest.

**Limited Partner (LP):** Investors who provide capital to a venture fund but don't participate in day-to-day management. LPs include pension funds, endowments, family offices, fund-of-funds, and HNW individuals.

**Management Fee:** Annual fee paid to GPs for fund operations, typically 2% of committed capital during investment period (4–5 years), then 2% of invested capital during harvest period. Covers salaries, office, travel, and operational costs.

**Carried Interest (Carry):** GP's share of fund profits, typically 20% after returning LP capital + preferred return. This is the primary economic incentive for GPs. Standard structure: 80/20 split (LP/GP) above hurdle.

**Preferred Return (Hurdle Rate):** Minimum annual return LPs must receive before GPs earn carry, typically 8%. Protects LP downside and aligns GP incentives with strong performance.

**GP Commit:** Capital the GP personally invests in the fund, typically 1–2% of fund size. Demonstrates skin in the game to LPs.

---

## Investment Terms

**Pre-Money Valuation:** Company valuation before new investment. If pre-money is $10M and investment is $2M → post-money is $12M → investor owns 16.7%.

**Post-Money Valuation:** Company valuation after investment. Post-money = Pre-money + Investment Amount.

**Pro-Rata Rights:** Right to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership percentage. Critical for seed investors to avoid dilution in Series A+.

**Liquidation Preference:** Determines payout order in exit/liquidation. "1x non-participating" = investors get money back first, then remaining proceeds to common. "1x participating" = get money back AND share in remaining.

**Anti-Dilution Protection:** Protects investors if company raises at lower valuation (down round). Weighted average anti-dilution is standard; full ratchet is aggressive.

**SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity):** Y Combinator-created instrument for seed investing. Converts to equity at next priced round. Simpler and cheaper than convertible notes.

**Convertible Note:** Debt instrument that converts to equity, with interest rate and maturity date. More complex than SAFEs but provides debt holder protections.

---

## Deal Flow & Process Terms

**Deal Flow:** Pipeline of investment opportunities. Quality > quantity. The best VCs convert 1–2% of deals they see.

**Due Diligence:** Investigation before investment — team, market, product/tech, financials, legal, customer references, competitive landscape. Typically 2–6 weeks for seed.

**Term Sheet:** Non-binding document outlining key investment terms: valuation, amount, board seats, protective provisions. Precedes definitive legal documents.

**Cap Table:** Ownership spreadsheet showing who owns what % — founders, employees (options), and investors across all rounds.

**Information Rights:** Right to receive periodic financial reports from portfolio company. Standard for investors above a minimum threshold.

---

## Return Metrics

**TVPI (Total Value to Paid-In):** Total fund value (realized + unrealized) / capital called. TVPI 3.0x = fund worth 3x what LPs invested.

**DPI (Distributions to Paid-In):** Cash returned to LPs / capital called. Shows actual realized returns (money in LP pockets).

**IRR (Internal Rate of Return):** Annualized return accounting for timing of cash flows. Top-quartile seed funds target 25%+ net IRR.

**MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital):** Simple return multiple. Total value / invested capital. Doesn't account for time.

**Power Law:** In venture, a small number of investments generate the vast majority of returns. One 50x return matters more than ten 2x returns.

# Step 5: Secret Sauce — Ainary Ventures' Investor Edge

## The Core Question

What makes Ainary Ventures different from the 600+ funds launched through VC Lab and the thousands of emerging managers globally?

---

## Ainary's Unfair Advantage: The AI-Native Operator

### Edge #1: Technical Depth + Business Acumen (Rare Combination)

Most VCs fall into one of two categories:
- **Technical background** — Can evaluate architecture but miss business model flaws
- **Business/finance background** — Understand markets but can't assess technical moats

**I am both.** Five years as a technical CEO building production AI systems means I can:

- **Evaluate AI architectures** — RAG pipelines, multi-agent systems, fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering, inference cost structures
- **Spot technical debt** — When a startup's "AI" is really just an API wrapper vs. genuine innovation
- **Assess scalability** — Whether the architecture breaks at 100x users or gracefully scales
- **AND** understand unit economics, go-to-market strategy, sales cycles, and founder psychology

**Concrete example:** I built a legal AI platform with a <0.2% hallucination rate using multi-agent verification architecture. This wasn't a ChatGPT wrapper — it required solving production-grade accuracy problems that most AI startups struggle with. When I evaluate an AI startup, I can immediately tell if their accuracy claims are achievable or marketing fiction.

**The insight I catch that others miss:** *"This AI startup has impressive demos but their inference costs at scale make unit economics impossible — they need 10x efficiency gains they haven't planned for."*

---

### Edge #2: Founder-Operator Pattern Recognition

I've lived the startup journey from both sides:
- **Raised €5.5M+** across VC rounds and grants (36ZERO Vision — computer vision SaaS)
- **Built and led** a team of 12 engineers building enterprise AI
- **Sold to enterprise customers** — understand procurement cycles, pilots, and expansion
- **Navigated** pivots, team changes, runway management, investor relationships

**What this means for portfolio founders:**
- I understand their actual problems, not theoretical ones
- I can help with fundraising strategy because I've done it
- I spot execution red flags because I've made those mistakes
- I earn founder trust faster because I'm not a tourist

**The insight I catch:** *"This founder is building features instead of talking to customers — I did the exact same thing in Year 2 and lost 6 months."*

**Key mistakes I made that I help founders avoid:**
1. Over-engineering before validating demand — building for 18 months before getting real customer feedback
2. Raising at wrong valuation — taking a high valuation early that made the next round nearly impossible
3. Hiring too fast pre-PMF — scaling the team before product-market fit was proven, burning cash

---

### Edge #3: AI-Native Workflow as Credibility Filter

I don't just invest in AI — I live it. My daily workflow runs on a compound AI system:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Specialized agents for research, writing, deal sourcing
- Automated weekly intelligence digests (144 sources → 10 key insights)
- AI-native CRM and knowledge management

**Why this matters:** AI founders can immediately tell if an investor truly understands AI or is just following the trend. When I show my workflow — or discuss multi-agent architectures, RAG optimization, or inference cost structures — founders know I speak their language.

**The selection filter:** This naturally attracts the best AI founders (who want a technical sparring partner) and filters out "AI-washing" companies (who know I'll see through the hype).

**The insight I catch:** *"This founder says 'proprietary AI' but they're wrapping a fine-tuned GPT-4 with no data flywheel. That's a feature, not a company."*

---

### Edge #4: European ↔ US Bridge

- **German technical education** — Rigorous engineering background
- **Munich/European startup network** — Deep connections across DACH tech ecosystem
- **NYC base** — US market access and enterprise buyer proximity
- **Cross-border experience** — Raised from both European and international investors

**The opportunity:** European AI talent often builds world-class technology but struggles with US market entry — pricing, positioning, sales culture, and investor relationships. I bridge both ecosystems and can source deals others miss.

**The insight I catch:** *"This German AI startup has incredible technology and 10 enterprise customers in Europe. They need help with US positioning and can be a breakout company with the right market entry."*

---

### Edge #5: Contrarian AI Belief

**My thesis that most VCs miss:** The biggest AI opportunity isn't in foundation models or horizontal tools — it's in **vertical AI for boring industries**. Legal document review, CNC manufacturing optimization, healthcare billing automation. These aren't sexy, but they have:
- Clear buyer willingness to pay
- Massive existing spend to displace
- Domain expertise as a durable moat
- Less competition from big tech

Most AI VCs chase the shiny object (foundation models, consumer AI). I focus on where AI creates the most measurable enterprise value.

---

## Thesis Alignment Summary

| Dimension | Ainary's Focus | Why Me Specifically |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Vertical AI** | Legal, Manufacturing, Healthcare | Built products in legal AI + manufacturing |
| **AI Infrastructure** | Observability, governance, memory | Use these tools daily; understand buyer needs |
| **AI-Native B2B** | Workflow-first, not feature-first | Living this model with my own compound system |
| **European AI → US** | Cross-border deal flow | Bilingual, bicultural, dual-network |

---

## The One-Liner

> **"I'm a technical founder who spent 5 years building AI products, raised €5.5M, and made every mistake in the book. I invest in AI-native B2B because I can tell what's real from what's hype — and I help founders avoid the traps I fell into."**

# Step 8: Thought Leadership — LinkedIn Strategy

## Strategy

Build visibility in the AI + VC intersection through consistent, insight-driven content that signals technical depth and operator experience.

---

## Immediate Action: Repost + Commentary

### Option A: Repost an AI VC post with operator insight

> **[Repost a post from Sarah Guo, Elad Gil, or similar AI investor]**
>
> This resonates. As a founder who built AI products for 5 years, I've seen this firsthand:
> 
> The AI companies that win aren't the ones with the most impressive demo — they're the ones where accuracy at scale is a solved problem, not a promise.
> 
> Building our legal AI platform, we hit 99.8% accuracy through multi-agent verification. That last 1% is where most AI startups die — and where the real defensibility lives.

### Option B: Repost a VC Lab or Decile post

> **[Repost VC Lab content]**
>
> Excited to be part of VC Lab Cohort 10, building Ainary Ventures — an AI-focused seed fund.
>
> After 5 years as a founder/CEO building AI products, I'm channeling that operator experience into backing the next generation of AI-native companies.
>
> If you're building vertical AI (legal, manufacturing, healthcare) or AI infrastructure — let's talk.

---

## Original Post: Ready to Publish

### "From Founder to VC: What Changes and What Doesn't"

> After 5 years as a startup CEO — raising €5.5M, building AI products, making every mistake possible — I'm transitioning to venture capital.
>
> The question everyone asks: "Why?"
>
> The honest answer: I realized the skills I built as a founder are exactly what AI startups need from their investors:
>
> ✅ I can evaluate if an AI architecture will scale (because I've built them)
> ✅ I can spot when a founder is building instead of selling (because I did it)
> ✅ I can help navigate enterprise sales cycles (because I've closed them)
> ✅ I can pressure-test fundraising strategy (because I've lived it)
>
> What doesn't change: the obsession with building something that matters.
>
> What changes: instead of doing it once, I get to help 10+ founders do it better.
>
> Currently building Ainary Ventures through VC Lab — focused on AI-native vertical software at pre-seed and seed.
>
> Other operators who've made this transition — what surprised you most?

# Appendix: Fund Economics Summary

## Ainary Ventures — Fund I Target Structure

| Parameter | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Fund Name** | Ainary Ventures Fund I | |
| **Fund Size** | $10–25M | Emerging manager range |
| **GP Commit** | 1–2% ($100K–$500K) | Standard for Fund I |
| **Management Fee** | 2% annually | During investment period (Years 1–4) |
| **Carried Interest** | 20% | Standard; above 8% preferred return |
| **Preferred Return** | 8% | Standard hurdle rate |
| **Investment Period** | 3–4 years | Active deployment |
| **Fund Life** | 10 years | + 2 year extension |
| **Target # of Investments** | 15–25 | Diversified seed portfolio |
| **Initial Check Size** | $250K–$750K | Scaling with fund size |
| **Follow-on Reserve** | 30–40% | Pro-rata in Series A+ |
| **Target Ownership** | 5–10% | At entry |
| **Target Net MOIC** | 3–5x | Top-quartile emerging manager |
| **Target Net IRR** | 25%+ | Over 10-year fund life |

### Fee Economics (at $15M fund size)

| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Annual management fee | $300K | 2% × $15M |
| Total fees over fund life | ~$2.4M | Declining in harvest years |
| GP commit (1.5%) | $225K | Florian's personal investment |
| Carry on 3x return | $4.5M | 20% × ($45M - $15M) gross, simplified |

### Stage Focus Rationale

**Pre-seed to Seed** because:
1. Operator insight adds most value at earliest stages
2. Technical due diligence is most differentiated pre-product
3. Smaller checks allow for diversified portfolio
4. Cross-border deal flow is most unique at seed
5. Alignment with $10–25M fund size economics
