## 💬 Conversation Starters

If there's awkward silence, pivot to:
- "What patterns are you seeing in AI-native founders?"
- "What made you transition from Microsoft to investing?"
- "What's your take on where applied AI creates the most enterprise value?"

---

## 🚨 Abort Signals

If she seems:
- **Distracted** → "Want to reschedule to a better time?"
- **Unimpressed** → Shift to questions, let her talk
- **Too impressed** → Transition to "What about your portfolio would benefit from this kind of thinking?"

## 📤 Post-Call (within 30 min)

1. [ ] LinkedIn connection request with personal note
2. [ ] Follow-up email:
   - Thank for specific insight she shared
   - One relevant link from conversation
   - Open door: "Happy to go deeper on [X] if interesting"
3. [ ] Update memory/2026-02-03.md with key learnings
4. [ ] Update MEMORY.md if she's a strong contact

## 🧘 Mindset

She reached out to YOU. She saw something interesting. You're not selling — you're showing how you think.

Be curious about her. Be authentic about what's working and what's still rough. Operators respect operators.

This is a conversation between two people who care about AI. That's it.
