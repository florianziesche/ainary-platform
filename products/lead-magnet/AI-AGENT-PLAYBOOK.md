The AI Agent Playbook
How I Run My Business With 10 AI Agents
By Florian Ziesche

**Page 1: The Problem**
You've heard AI can 10x your productivity. You've tried ChatGPT. It was... fine.
But "using AI" and "running AI agents" are completely different things.
This playbook shows you the difference.

**Page 2: My Setup (The Org Chart)**
Visual: Florian → Mia (COO) → 10 Agents
- Each agent: Name, Role, 1-sentence job description
- Not theory. This is my actual daily setup.

**Page 3: What Is an AI Agent? (Not What You Think)**
- An agent is NOT a chatbot you talk to
- An agent is: role + context + expectations + quality gates
- Think: a junior employee who never sleeps, costs $0.50/hour, but needs clear instructions

**Page 4: The 5 Rules of Agent Management**
1. Define "done" before they start
2. Give context, not just instructions
3. Review like a manager, not a user
4. Build systems, not prompts
5. Measure outcomes, not output

**Page 5-6: What Actually Works (With Real Numbers)**
- Research: 2 days manual → 15 minutes with agent
- Outreach: 20 personalized emails overnight, $2 cost
- Content: 1 article → 5 formats in 30 minutes
- Analysis: 40+ files read, patterns identified, gaps flagged

**Page 7-8: What Doesn't Work (Honest)**
- Judgment calls (which email to send first)
- Relationship building (trust, body language, timing)
- Quality without constraints (garbage in, garbage out)
- The "send" button (AI doesn't fix procrastination)

**Page 9: The Uncomfortable Truth**
- My actual numbers: 50 prepared, 2 sent
- AI exposes your bottleneck. It's never technical.
- The real skill: pressing send

**Page 10: How To Start (Your First Agent)**
Step 1: Pick ONE recurring task (research, drafting, analysis)
Step 2: Write a clear brief (who, what, why, how, done = ?)
Step 3: Run it 5 times. Review every output.
Step 4: Refine the brief. Repeat.
Step 5: Add a second agent only when the first one delivers consistently.

**Page 11: The Stack (What I Use)**
- Orchestration: OpenClaw
- Models: Claude (Anthropic), GPT-4 (OpenAI)
- Knowledge Base: Obsidian
- Automation: n8n
- CRM: HubSpot
- Content: Substack + LinkedIn
(Not affiliate links. Just what works.)

**Page 12: The ROI**
- Cost: ~$15-30/day in API calls
- Output: equivalent of 2-3 junior employees
- Time saved: 4-6 hours/day
- BUT: only valuable if you DO something with the output

**Page 13: Common Mistakes**
1. Starting with 10 agents (start with 1)
2. No quality gates (AI output needs review)
3. Expecting autonomy (AI is a multiplier, not a replacement)
4. Confusing busy with productive (50 documents ≠ 1 customer)
5. Not iterating (your first agent setup WILL suck)
