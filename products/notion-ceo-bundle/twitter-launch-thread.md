## The Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
🚀 I just launched something I've used for 5 years.

The CEO Framework: 10 Notion templates that ran my venture-backed startup.

From daily planning to closing deals.

Here's what's inside (and why it works) 🧵

---

### Tweet 2 (Credibility)
First, some context:

• Built a startup from 0 → €5.5M raised
• Managed 15 people across 3 countries
• Delivered to Fortune 500 clients
• Made every productivity mistake possible

These templates are what survived.

---

### Tweet 3 (Daily Plan)
**1. DAILY PLAN TEMPLATE**

Every morning, same routine:
→ Top 3 priorities (not 10)
→ Time blocks
→ End-of-day review

Simple. But 90% of people don't do it.

This template makes it automatic.

---

### Tweet 4 (Weekly Sprint)
**2. WEEKLY SPRINT**

I run my week like a product sprint:

Monday: Plan
Tue-Thu: Execute
Friday: Review + Retro

Built-in accountability.
Built-in learning.

Most "weekly planners" miss the retro. That's where growth happens.

---

### Tweet 5 (Lead Tracker)
**3. LEAD TRACKER**

A CRM that actually fits how founders sell:

→ Pipeline stages (not 47 fields)
→ Follow-up reminders
→ Win/loss analysis

I've seen founders lose $50K deals because they forgot to follow up.

This template fixes that.

---

### Tweet 6 (Discovery Call)
**4. DISCOVERY CALL PREP**

Never wing a sales call again.

Pre-call:
• Company research
• Key questions
• Objection responses

Post-call:
• Qualification score
• Next steps

One template. Every call.

---

### Tweet 7 (Proposal)
**5. PROPOSAL TEMPLATE**

My proposals had a 60%+ close rate.

Not because I'm special. Because the structure works:

Problem → Solution → Timeline → Investment → Why Us

Copy the structure. Win more deals.

---

### Tweet 8 (Client Delivery)
**6. CLIENT DELIVERY PLAN**

This one saved me multiple times.

Every client gets:
→ Milestones
→ Deliverables tracker
→ Communication log
→ Risk register

Clients feel taken care of.
You never drop balls.

---

### Tweet 9 (The Rest)
**Plus 4 more:**

7. Meeting Notes — Decisions + action items
8. Sprint Retrospective — Learn every week
9. Strategy Capture — Think clearly on paper
10. Task Kanban — Visualize everything

Each one tested over 5 years of building.

---

### Tweet 10 (Social Proof)
The early feedback:

"Finally, templates that make sense for founders."

"Saved me 20+ hours of setup."

"I actually USE these, unlike the 50 other templates I've downloaded."
