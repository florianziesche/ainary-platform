The exact Notion system I used to run a €5.5M venture-backed startup. 10 templates from daily planning to client delivery.

## Full Description

### 🎯 Stop Building Systems. Start Executing.

I spent 5 years as a startup CEO.

Raised €5.5M. Built a team of 15. Shipped products. Closed deals. Made mistakes.

**These templates ran my entire operation.**

Every morning started with the Daily Plan. Every week kicked off with Sprint Planning. Every client had a Delivery Plan. Every deal went through the Lead Tracker.

Now I'm sharing them with you.

### ⚡ Why These Templates Work

**Battle-Tested**
These aren't theoretical templates I made to sell. They're the actual systems I used to:
- Raise €5.5M from VCs and angels
- Manage a 15-person team across 3 countries
- Deliver projects to Fortune 500 clients
- Navigate a startup through COVID and beyond

**Interconnected**
The templates work together. Leads flow into Clients. Meetings generate Action Items. Sprints feed Retrospectives. It's a system, not a collection of files.

**Instantly Usable**
Duplicate. Customize. Start using today. No 50-page setup guides. No complex configurations.
