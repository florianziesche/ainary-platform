# 5 AI Mistakes That Cost You 10+ Hours Every Week
## (And How to Fix Them Today)

*A free guide by Florian Ziesche*

## Introduction

You're using AI wrong.

Not because you're stupid. Because everyone taught you wrong.

They said: "Just ask ChatGPT your questions."

That's like hiring an assistant and only asking them yes/no questions.

In this guide, I'll show you the 5 mistakes that keep you stuck — and the fixes that took me from "AI is neat" to "AI runs half my business."

Let's go.

## Mistake #1: Treating AI Like Google

**The Problem:**
You open ChatGPT. You ask a question. You get an answer. You close the tab.

Tomorrow, you do the same thing. The AI has no idea who you are, what you're working on, or what you talked about yesterday.

Every conversation starts from zero.

**The Cost:**
- 5-10 minutes of context-setting per conversation
- Generic answers that don't fit your situation
- No compound learning

**The Fix:**
Give your AI a "briefing document."

Create a single file that includes:
- Who you are
- What you're working on
- Your preferences and style
- Key context about your business

Paste it at the start of important conversations. Or better: use Claude Projects or Custom GPTs that remember.

**Time Saved:** 30+ minutes per day

## Mistake #2: Asking Questions Instead of Assigning Tasks

**The Problem:**
"What are some good marketing strategies for a SaaS product?"

This gets you a generic list. Nice, but useless.

**The Cost:**
- Answers that don't apply to you
- More work to adapt generic advice
- No actionable output

**The Fix:**
Assign tasks, not questions.

"I'm launching a B2B SaaS for legal teams. We have $2K marketing budget and 0 followers. Create a 30-day launch plan with specific actions for each week. Focus on LinkedIn and cold email."

See the difference? The output is actually usable.

**Template:**
```
You are a [role].
I need you to [specific task].
Context: [your situation]
Constraints: [budget, time, resources]
Output format: [how you want it delivered]
```

**Time Saved:** 2+ hours per project

## Mistake #3: Starting Fresh Every Time

**The Problem:**
You had a great conversation last week. AI gave you perfect advice for your product launch. Today, you need follow-up help.

But AI forgot everything. You're starting from scratch.

**The Cost:**
- Re-explaining context constantly
- Inconsistent advice
- No continuity in your work

**The Fix:**
Build an external memory system.

Simple version:
- Keep a running document called "AI Context"
- After important conversations, paste key decisions
- Before new conversations, paste relevant context

Advanced version:
- Use a tool like Obsidian or Notion as your "second brain"
- Connect it to your AI workflow
- Let context accumulate automatically

**The principle:** Everything your AI learns should be saved somewhere you control.

**Time Saved:** 1+ hour per major project

## Mistake #4: Doing Everything in Chat

**The Problem:**
Chat is great for questions. It's terrible for systems.

If you're doing the same type of work repeatedly in chat, you're wasting time.

**The Cost:**
- Same prompts written over and over
- Inconsistent outputs
- No leverage from past work

**The Fix:**
Build templates and automations.

**Templates:**
For any task you do more than twice:
1. Write a perfect prompt once
2. Save it
3. Reuse with just the variable parts changed

Example: "Summarize this article" becomes a template with a slot for the article.

**Automations:**
Connect AI to other tools:
- Zapier/Make for triggers
- Calendar for time-based actions
- Email for monitoring

**The goal:** You shouldn't have to open ChatGPT for routine work. It should happen automatically.

**Time Saved:** 5+ hours per week

## Mistake #5: No Feedback Loop

**The Problem:**
AI gives you something. You use it. You move on.

You never tell AI what worked and what didn't.

**The Cost:**
- Same mistakes repeated
- No improvement over time
- Generic outputs stay generic

**The Fix:**
Create a feedback loop.

After every major AI-assisted task:
1. What worked well?
2. What would you change?
3. Update your context documents

**Example feedback:**
"The last email you wrote was too formal. For future emails, be more casual — use contractions, shorter sentences."

Save this. Next time, include it in your context.

Over time, your AI becomes perfectly tuned to you.

**Time Saved:** Compounds — starts small, becomes massive

## The Big Picture

These aren't just tips. They're a mindset shift.

**Old way:** AI = fancy search engine
**New way:** AI = employee that gets better every day

The difference after 30 days is 10x.
The difference after 90 days is 100x.
