# AI Implementation Services

## Florian Ziesche — Production AI Systems

## The Problem

Most AI implementations fail. Not because the technology doesn't work, but because:

- **Demo ≠ Production:** What works in a sandbox breaks in the real world
- **No verification:** AI confidently makes things up
- **No integration:** Standalone tools that don't fit workflows
- **No iteration:** One-and-done projects that never improve

**Result:** Expensive experiments that never reach production.

---

## The Solution

I build AI systems that actually work — in production, at scale, with real users.

### What I Deliver:

| Service | What You Get | Timeline |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **AI Strategy Workshop** | Clear roadmap, use case prioritization, build vs buy | 1 day |
| **Implementation Sprint** | Working system, documentation, training | 2-4 weeks |
| **System Audit** | Assessment of existing AI, improvement plan | 1 week |
| **Ongoing Support** | Maintenance, optimization, new features | Monthly |

## Track Record

### Legal AI System
- **Challenge:** 5% hallucination rate unacceptable for lawyers
- **Solution:** Multi-agent verification architecture
- **Result:** **0.18% error rate**, 78% user adoption (up from 12%)

### Enterprise RAG
- **Challenge:** Generic ChatGPT integration not useful
- **Solution:** Hybrid retrieval + domain-specific tuning
- **Result:** **10x query volume**, measurable productivity gains

### Manufacturing AI
- **Challenge:** Manual CNC time calculations (30 min each)
- **Solution:** Automated calculation + NC code generation
- **Result:** **2 minutes** per calculation, 10+ hours/week saved
