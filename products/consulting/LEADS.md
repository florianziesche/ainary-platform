## Outreach Templates

### LinkedIn Connection Request
```
Hi [Name],

Saw your work at [Company] — impressive [specific thing].

I help companies build AI systems that actually work in production (not just demos). Former startup CEO, raised €5.5M, now consulting.

Would love to connect and hear what AI challenges you're tackling.

Best,
Florian
```

### LinkedIn DM (After Connected)
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! 

Quick question: Is [Company] exploring AI for [specific use case]?

I've been helping companies implement production AI systems — my last project reduced hallucination rates from 5% to 0.2% for a legal tech company.

Happy to share insights if useful. No pitch, just curious what's on your radar.

Florian
```

### Email (Warm Intro)
```
Subject: AI Implementation — Quick Question

Hi [Name],

[Mutual] suggested I reach out — they mentioned you're exploring AI at [Company].

Quick background: I spent 5 years as an AI startup CEO, raised €5.5M, and now help companies build AI systems that work in production (not just impressive demos).

Recent project: Reduced a legal AI system's error rate from 5% to 0.2% using a multi-agent verification architecture.

Would a 20-minute call be useful to explore if I could help with [specific challenge]?

Best,
Florian

P.S. Happy to share the architecture that achieved sub-0.2% hallucination rates — it's surprisingly applicable across domains.
```

### Cold Email (Direct)
```
Subject: AI that actually works — for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Most AI implementations fail because they're demos, not systems.

I help companies build AI that works in production:
- Legal AI with <0.2% hallucination rate
- RAG systems that cite sources
- Workflows that save 10+ hours/week

Former startup CEO (€5.5M raised). Now selective consulting.

Quick question: Is [Company] building or evaluating AI solutions right now?

If yes, 20 minutes might save you months.
