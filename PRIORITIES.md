# Priorities — Week of Feb 1-7, 2026

*Updated: 2026-02-01 by Atlas*

## 🔥 This Week's #1 Priority

**Maschinenbau Schlottwitz** — Schedule meeting with uncle, close pilot deal.

Why: You're physically there. The tool exists. This is the fastest path to real revenue (€5-10K setup + €500-750/month). One deal could cover 50% of your income gap.

## Revenue Path (Hybrid Strategy)

```
Current: €0/month
  │
  ├─► ALG 1: +€2,700/month (next week)
  │
  ├─► Maschinenbau: +€750/month (if closed this week)
  │     └─ Setup: €5,000 one-time
  │
  ├─► VC Job: +€7-12K/month (3-6 month timeline)
  │
  └─► Target: €6,000/month ✓
```

**Math:** ALG 1 (€2,700) + Maschinenbau (€750) = €3,450/month
That covers minimum needs while hunting for VC job.

## Decisions Needed from Florian

1. **Uncle contact** — Do you have his number? When can you meet?
2. **Decile contact info** — LinkedIn URL, email, phone for cover letter
3. **Sprint 2 Step 5** — Add your specific examples (contrarian beliefs, mistakes, references)
4. **Startup credits** — DigoDigest or different vehicle? (I have questions about this)

## What I'm NOT Prioritizing (and why)

- **Website rebuild** — Nice to have, not urgent. VC job or revenue first.
- **Startup credits** — Research needed, but won't move needle this week.
- **Content/LinkedIn** — Good for visibility, but direct action (applications, uncle deal) is higher ROI right now.
