Dear Wingspan Capital Team,

You're looking for a digital native who can bridge finance and technology. I'm the founder who raised €5.5M, built AI systems from scratch, and now wants to deploy that velocity on the buy side.

Most finance people dabble in tech. I build it. I just shipped an AI agent system that produces 55-page executive briefs in 45 minutes — the kind of workflow automation that will define the next decade of asset management. Before that, I spent five years as CEO of 36ZERO Vision (cloud computer vision SaaS), scaling from zero to €5.5M raised and a 15-person team. I know what it takes to build in niche, non-traditional markets because I've lived it.

That founder perspective is exactly why I'm pursuing the investor seat. Through Decile Hub's VC Lab and launching Ainary Ventures (my $5M seed fund focused on AI-first European founders scaling in the US), I've developed a thesis: the best investors understand operators because they've been operators. Your direct-report-to-founder structure resonates — I know how founders think, what keeps them up at night, and how to diligence beyond the deck.

On your three core responsibilities:

**Manager Research & Diligence:** I've evaluated hundreds of founders and understand technical moats in AI/deep tech. Writing 8 white papers annually? I publish actively on Substack and LinkedIn (recent post: 13,984 impressions on one-person companies and AI leverage).

**Data & CRM Overhaul:** This is what I do. I architect AI systems using LLMs, agentic workflows, RAG, and multi-agent orchestration. I don't just "manage" tech implementation — I spec it, build it, and ship it.

**Investor Relations & BD:** I've pitched LPs, closed funding rounds, and know how to translate complex strategies into compelling narratives.

I work at velocity because I've built the tools that enable it. Wingspan's focus on niche, non-traditional markets in a boutique structure is exactly where that combination of operator intuition and technical leverage creates asymmetric value.

Happy to discuss how I can contribute to your portfolio strategy and infrastructure.

Best,
