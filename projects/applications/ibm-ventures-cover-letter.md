Dear IBM Ventures Team,

I'm writing to apply for the Investor role at IBM Ventures. I understand founders because I am one—and that perspective, combined with deep technical AI expertise, is exactly what portfolio companies need when navigating IBM's ecosystem.

Over the past five years as CEO of 36ZERO Vision, I raised €5.5M+ across equity and grants, built a 15-person team, and sold cloud-based computer vision infrastructure to enterprise clients. I know what it's like to pitch institutional investors, negotiate term sheets, hire your first 10 employees, and figure out product-market fit while managing runway. That lived experience means I can add genuine value to portfolio companies—not just capital, but the operational insight that only comes from building.

What makes this match particularly strong: I'm technically deep in AI. I've built production LLM systems, multi-agent architectures, and RAG pipelines—the exact technologies IBM is platformizing with watsonx. Last month, I used an AI agent system I built myself to produce a 55-page strategic brief for a 750-employee CEO in 45 minutes. I don't just understand AI from a thesis perspective—I ship it. This technical fluency means I can speak credibly with technical founders, help portfolio companies leverage IBM's AI infrastructure, and identify which startups are building real differentiation versus riding hype.

I'm currently in Decile Hub's VC Lab and building Ainary Ventures, a $5M seed fund focused on AI-first European founders entering the US market. I live in NYC, understand the startup ecosystem here, and have already been deepening relationships with founders, LPs, and fellow investors. I know how to execute events, build partnerships, and amplify portfolio companies through content and community—skills this role explicitly requires.

IBM Ventures sits at a rare intersection: corporate resources, cutting-edge AI platform, and startup agility. I want to be the person who helps founders unlock that combination—because I've been on the other side of the table, and I know what actually moves the needle.

Let's talk about how I can contribute.

Best regards,  
Florian Ziesche
