# AI Company X-Ray — Go-To-Market Strategy
## "From Zero to 1,000 Reports in 30 Days"

*Author: Mia (Strategy Agent) | Date: 2026-02-12*
*Status: DRAFT — Florian Review Required*

## The Product in One Sentence

**A free AI-powered strategic audit that replaces $200K consulting engagements — and captures enterprise leads in the process.**

---

## GTM Philosophy

This is NOT a SaaS product launch. This is a **lead generation machine disguised as a free tool.** Every report generated = a qualified enterprise lead. The tool IS the marketing.

**The equation:**
```
Free Tool → Email Capture → Qualified Lead → Consulting Call → €5K-€50K Engagement
```

**Unit Economics (conservative):**
- Cost per report: ~$0.15 (API)
- Cost per lead: ~$0.15 (!!!)
- Consulting close rate: 5-10%
- Average deal: €10K
- → 1,000 reports = 1,000 leads = 50-100 calls = 5-10 deals = €50K-€100K

**Compare:** Google Ads for "AI consulting" = €15-€40 per click. We generate leads at $0.15. That's 100-250x cheaper.

## PHASE 1: LAUNCH WEEK (Days 1-7)

### Day 1-2: Deploy + Content

**Deploy:**
- GitHub Pages (done) → custom domain: `xray.ainaryventures.com` or `xray.florianziesche.com`
- Add Plausible/Umami analytics (privacy-first, no cookie banner needed)
- Email capture → Airtable or Google Sheets webhook

**Content Blitz:**
1. **LinkedIn Post** (Day 1): "I built an AI system that generates McKinsey-grade company audits in 2 minutes. It's free. Here's the Siemens report."
   - Attach screenshot of Siemens report
   - Link to tool
   - This post WILL go viral based on Florian's proven formula (personal story + specific numbers)
   
2. **Twitter/X Thread** (Day 1): "I replaced a $200K McKinsey engagement with 5 AI agents. Here's what they found about Siemens. [Thread]"
   - 10 tweets, each with a screenshot from a different section
   - Last tweet: link to tool

3. **Substack Article** (Day 2): "How I Built an AI System That Makes McKinsey Obsolete"
   - Deep technical dive
   - Shows the Hyperthink architecture
   - Embedded Siemens example
   - CTA: Try it yourself

### Day 3-5: Seed Distribution

**The 5 Consultancy Strategy (Florian's Idea — BRILLIANT):**

Give free white-label access to 5 mid-tier consultancies. They use it, we get:
- Logo on "Trusted By" section
- Case studies from their clients
- Referral traffic
- Credibility boost

**Target Consultancies (German Mittelstand focus):**
1. **Horváth** — Strategy & digital transformation, Mittelstand clients
2. **MHP** — Porsche subsidiary, manufacturing + digital
3. **Capgemini Invent Germany** — AI practice, need differentiation tools
4. **Accenture Song (DE)** — Smaller teams need leverage tools
5. **Roland Berger** — German heritage, AI transformation practice

**The Pitch:** "Your consultants spend 2 weeks on initial AI assessments. This does it in 2 minutes. Use it for free. We just want to be listed as a technology partner."

**Alternative: Smaller/Hungrier Firms (faster yes):**
1. Digital McKinsey Alternatives (keine Big 4) in DACH
2. AI-focused boutiques who lack proprietary tools
3. Freelance strategy consultants (network effect)

### Day 5-7: Community Seeding

- **Product Hunt launch** — "AI Company X-Ray: Free McKinsey-grade AI audit for any company"
- **Hacker News** — "Show HN: I built 5 AI agents that audit companies' AI strategy"
- **Reddit** — r/artificial, r/consulting, r/venturecapital
- **LinkedIn Groups** — AI Strategy, Digital Transformation, CTO Forums
- **IndieHackers** — Build in public post

---

## PHASE 2: GROWTH ENGINE (Days 7-21)

### Viral Loop Mechanics

**Built-in virality:**
1. Report has "Share this report" button → generates unique URL
2. Footer: "Get your company's X-Ray free at [link]"
3. CEO gets report → shares with CTO → CTO runs report on competitor → loop

**Social Proof Accumulation:**
- Counter on homepage: "X reports generated"
- "Recent X-Rays" feed (anonymized): "A Fortune 500 manufacturing company..." 
- Testimonial collection (auto-email 24h after report)

### Content Flywheel

Every week, publish one "AI X-Ray Spotlight":
- Pick an interesting public company
- Run the full X-Ray
- Write a LinkedIn post analyzing the results
- Tag the company (they'll engage or share)

**Week 1:** Siemens (done)
**Week 2:** Tesla (controversial = viral)
**Week 3:** Deutsche Bank (Florian's finance network)
**Week 4:** SAP (German tech, AI transformation story)

### SEO Play

Create `/reports/{company}` pages that are indexable:
- "Siemens AI Strategy Analysis 2026"
- "BMW AI Readiness Assessment"
- People Google "[company] AI strategy" → they find us

## COMPETITIVE MOAT

**Why can't McKinsey just build this?**
1. They can't give it away free — it cannibalizes their $200K engagements
2. Their brand prevents "provocateur" honesty — they can't say what the client doesn't want to hear
3. They're too slow — this ships in days, they'd take months
4. They don't have the AI architecture — Hyperthink is genuinely novel

**Why can't a random developer clone it?**
1. Prompt engineering is the moat — our 5 agents took 20+ iterations to get right
2. Hyperthink's 3-round critique catches errors that single-pass LLMs miss
3. The consulting credibility behind it matters — "by an ex-CEO who's done AI transformation"
4. First-mover + brand = defensible

## THE BIGGER PICTURE

```
AI Company X-Ray (Consulting leads)
        +
Startup X-Ray (VC deal flow + VC job demo)
        +
Content from every report (LinkedIn, Substack)
        +
Consulting engagements ($€€€)
        =
THE FLORIAN ZIESCHE AI PLATFORM
```

This isn't one product. It's an **ecosystem** where every piece feeds the others. The X-Ray generates leads AND content AND credibility AND demo material for VC jobs.

**This is the compound machine we've been talking about — but actually built.**
