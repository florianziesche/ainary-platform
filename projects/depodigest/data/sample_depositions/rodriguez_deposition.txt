5                    EXAMINATION
6              BY MR. CHEN:
7
8    Q.    Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. My name is
9    Robert Chen, and I represent Maria Martinez.
10   Can you please state your full name for the
11   record?
12
13   A.    Carlos Miguel Rodriguez.
14
15   Q.    And what is your relationship to this case?
16
17   A.    I was an eyewitness to the accident.
18
19   Q.    Where were you on the morning of October 14,
20   2025?
21
22   A.    I was waiting at the bus stop on the corner
23   of Atlantic and Flatbush.
24
25   Q.    What time was this?
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 5

1    A.    Around 7:30 in the morning. I was on my
2    way to work.
3
4    Q.    Did you see the accident occur?
5
6    A.    Yes, I saw the whole thing.
7
8    Q.    Please describe what you observed.
9
10   A.    I was standing at the bus stop, looking
11   toward the intersection. I saw the woman—the
12   plaintiff, Ms. Martinez—she was in the crosswalk,
13   crossing Atlantic Avenue.
14
15   Q.    What was she doing?
16
17   A.    She was just walking across. She had the
18   walk signal.
19
20   Q.    You're certain she had the walk signal?
21
22   A.    Yes, absolutely. I was watching because I
23   was thinking about crossing there myself. The
24   white walk sign was lit up.
25
26   Q.    What happened next?

_____________________________________________________________

Page 6

1    A.    The truck came through the intersection.
2    It didn't stop. It hit her.
3
4    Q.    Let me break that down. First, where did
5    the truck come from?
6
7    A.    It was coming from the west, traveling
8    east on Atlantic Avenue.
9
10   Q.    What was the traffic signal for vehicles
11   on Atlantic Avenue at that moment?
12
13   A.    It was red. The light had just turned red.
14
15   Q.    You're certain the light was red?
16
17   A.    Yes. The walk signal was on for pedestrians,
18   which means the traffic light had to be red.
19   They're connected, you know?
20
21   Q.    Did the truck attempt to stop?
22
23   A.    No, it went right through. It looked like
24   the driver wasn't even paying attention.
25
26   Q.    What makes you say that?

_____________________________________________________________

Page 7

1    A.    He was looking down. I could see through
2    the windshield. His head was down, like he was
3    looking at something in his lap. Maybe a phone.
4
5    Q.    Did you see a phone?
6
7    A.    I couldn't see specifically what it was,
8    but his head was definitely down. He wasn't
9    looking at the road.
10
11   Q.    How fast would you estimate the truck was
12   traveling?
13
14   A.    Fast. Too fast. I'd say at least 35 or 40
15   miles per hour.
16
17   Q.    And what is your understanding of the
18   speed limit on that stretch of Atlantic Avenue?
19
20   A.    I think it's 25. Maybe 30 at most.
21
22   Q.    So the truck was exceeding the speed limit?
23
24   A.    Definitely. Way too fast for that area,
25   especially with pedestrians around.
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 8

1    Q.    What happened when the truck struck
2    Ms. Martinez?
3
4    A.    It was horrible. She went up over the
5    hood and then fell to the ground. The truck
6    kept going for maybe 20 or 30 feet before it
7    stopped.
8
9    Q.    Did the truck stop at the scene?
10
11   A.    Yes, eventually. The driver got out. He
12   looked shocked.
13
14   Q.    Did you hear the driver say anything?
15
16   A.    Yes, he was on the phone calling 911. And
17   I heard him say something like, "Oh God, I
18   didn't see her."
19
20   Q.    "I didn't see her"?
21
22   A.    Yes, that's what I heard him say.
23
24   Q.    Did you speak to the driver?
25
26   A.    Briefly. I went over to help. I asked him

_____________________________________________________________

Page 9

1    what happened, and he said he was trying to
2    make the light.
3
4    Q.    He said he was trying to make the light?
5
6    A.    Yes.
7
8    Q.    But you testified the light was already
9    red when the truck entered the intersection?
10
11   A.    That's right. It was red. He ran the red
12   light.
13
14   Q.    Did the driver say anything else?
15
16   A.    He said something about being late for a
17   delivery. He seemed upset about being behind
18   schedule.
19
20              MS. THOMPSON: Objection, hearsay.
21
22              MR. CHEN: It's an admission by a
23   party opponent.
24
25   Q.    What exactly did he say about being late?
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 10

1    A.    He said, "I was already running late. My
2    dispatcher is going to kill me." Something
3    like that.
4
5    Q.    Did the driver appear fatigued to you?
6
7    A.    Now that you mention it, yes. He looked
8    tired. His eyes were red, like he hadn't
9    slept much.
10
11   Q.    Did you provide a statement to the police?
12
13   A.    Yes, I stayed at the scene and talked to
14   the officer who responded.
15
16   Q.    Did you tell the officer what you told me
17   today?
18
19   A.    Yes, everything. That the woman had the
20   walk signal, that the truck ran the red light,
21   that the driver wasn't looking at the road.
22
23   Q.    Mr. Rodriguez, in your opinion, who was
24   at fault for this accident?
25
26              MS. THOMPSON: Objection, calls for

_____________________________________________________________

Page 11

1    a legal conclusion.
2
3              MR. CHEN: I'll rephrase. Based on
4    what you observed, did Ms. Martinez do anything
5    wrong?
6
7    A.    No. She was in the crosswalk. She had
8    the walk signal. She was doing exactly what
9    she was supposed to do.
10
11   Q.    And the truck driver?
12
13   A.    He ran a red light while looking at his
14   phone, going way too fast. It was completely
15   his fault.
16
17              MS. THOMPSON: Move to strike the
18   last portion as a legal conclusion.
19
20   Q.    Mr. Rodriguez, have you ever met
21   Ms. Martinez before that day?
22
23   A.    No, never.
24
25   Q.    Do you have any relationship with her or
26   her attorneys?

_____________________________________________________________

Page 12

1    A.    No. I'm just a witness to what happened.
2
3    Q.    Have you been promised anything for your
4    testimony today?
5
6    A.    No. I'm just here to tell the truth about
7    what I saw.
8
9    Q.    Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez. Let me ask you
10   a few more questions about the scene.
11
12   A.    Sure.
13
14   Q.    How far were you from the point of impact?
15
16   A.    Maybe 30 or 40 feet. Close enough to see
17   everything clearly.
18
19   Q.    Was your view obstructed in any way?
20
21   A.    No. I had a clear view of the intersection.
22
23   Q.    What were the weather conditions that
24   morning?
25
26   A.    Clear. Sunny. Good visibility.

_____________________________________________________________

Page 13

1    Q.    Any construction or obstacles in the
2    intersection?
3
4    A.    No, it was clear.
5
6    Q.    Were there other pedestrians in the
7    crosswalk at the time?
8
9    A.    I don't think so. Ms. Martinez was the
10   only one I saw crossing.
11
12   Q.    Did you see how she reacted before being
13   struck?
14
15   A.    She didn't have time to react. The truck
16   was on her before she could do anything.
17
18   Q.    Did the truck have its headlights on?
19
20   A.    I'm not sure. I think so.
21
22   Q.    Did you hear any horn or brakes before
23   the impact?
24
25   A.    No. No horn. I didn't hear any brakes
26   screeching either. It was like the driver

_____________________________________________________________

Page 14

1    didn't even try to stop.
2
3    Q.    You mentioned earlier that the driver's
4    head was down. How long was his head down
5    before the impact?
6
7    A.    The whole time I was watching. At least
8    a few seconds. Long enough for me to notice
9    it and think, "That guy's not watching the
10   road."
11
12   Q.    Did you form any other impressions about
13   the driver's state at the time of the accident?
14
15   A.    Just that he seemed distracted and in a
16   hurry. Not paying attention to what he was
17   doing.
18
19              MR. CHEN: I have no further questions
20   at this time.

1              EXAMINATION
2              BY MS. THOMPSON:
3
4    Q.    Mr. Rodriguez, you testified that the
5    traffic light was red when the truck entered
6    the intersection, correct?
7
8    A.    Yes.
9
10   Q.    But isn't it true that your attention was
11   on the pedestrian signal, not the traffic
12   light?
13
14   A.    I saw both. The walk signal was on, which
15   means the traffic light was red.
16
17   Q.    But you didn't specifically look at the
18   traffic light itself?
19
20   A.    Not specifically, but I know how the
21   signals work. If the walk sign is on, the
22   traffic light is red.
23
24   Q.    You estimated the truck's speed at 35 to
25   40 miles per hour. Do you have any training
26   in estimating vehicle speeds?

_____________________________________________________________

Page 53

1    A.    No formal training. But I've been driving
2    for 30 years. I know what fast looks like.
3
4    Q.    So your estimate is just a guess?
5
6    A.    It's an estimate based on experience. The
7    truck was going fast. Too fast.
8
9    Q.    You said you saw the driver looking down.
10   From 30 to 40 feet away, through a windshield,
11   you could see what direction his head was
12   pointed?
13
14   A.    Yes. It was obvious.
15
16   Q.    Could he have been looking at his
17   dashboard? His mirrors?
18
19   A.    His head was down, like looking at his
20   lap. Not at the dashboard or mirrors.
21
22   Q.    You said you heard the driver say "I
23   didn't see her." Isn't it possible you
24   misheard?
25
26   A.    No. I was right there. He said it clearly.

_____________________________________________________________

Page 54

1    Q.    You testified you spoke briefly with the
2    driver. How long was this conversation?
3
4    A.    Just a minute or two. He was upset.
5
6    Q.    And in that brief, emotional moment, you
7    remember his exact words about being late?
8
9    A.    Yes. "I was already running late. My
10   dispatcher is going to kill me." That stuck
11   with me.
12
13   Q.    Mr. Rodriguez, is it possible that
14   Ms. Martinez stepped into the crosswalk just
15   as the signal was changing?
16
17   A.    No. The walk signal was solid white when
18   she started crossing. It wasn't flashing.
19
20   Q.    You're certain of that?
21
22   A.    Yes. I was watching because I was thinking
23   about crossing too. The signal had just come
24   on.
25
26              MS. THOMPSON: No further questions.
