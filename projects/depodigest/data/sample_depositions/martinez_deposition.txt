Page 8

1    Q.    Mr. Wilson, I want to direct your attention
2    to October 14, 2025. Do you recall that date?
3
4    A.    Yes, that's the date of the accident.
5
6    Q.    Where were you going that morning?
7
8    A.    I was making a delivery to a warehouse in
9    Red Hook.
10
11   Q.    What time did you start your shift that day?
12
13   A.    I started at 4:00 a.m.
14
15   Q.    And what time did the accident occur?
16
17   A.    Around 7:30 in the morning.
18
19   Q.    So you had been driving for approximately
20   three and a half hours at that point?
21
22   A.    Yes, that's correct.
23
24   Q.    How much sleep did you get the night before?
25
26   A.    I'd say maybe four or five hours.

_____________________________________________________________

Page 9

1    Q.    Is that typical for you before a shift?
2
3    A.    Sometimes. It depends.
4
5    Q.    Do you recall what you were doing the night
6    before that limited your sleep?
7
8    A.    I was watching the game. Yankees playoff
9    game went late.
10
11   Q.    What time did you go to bed?
12
13   A.    Around midnight, maybe a little after.
14
15   Q.    And you woke up at what time to start your
16   4:00 a.m. shift?
17
18   A.    Around 3:15 or so.
19
20   Q.    So approximately three hours of sleep?
21
22   A.    I guess so, if you do the math.
23
24              MS. THOMPSON: Objection, asked and
25   answered. He said four to five hours.
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 10

1              MR. CHEN: The witness just confirmed
2    three hours based on the times he provided.
3
4    Q.    Mr. Wilson, which is it - three hours or
5    four to five hours?
6
7    A.    I don't know exactly. It was a few hours.
8    Maybe I fell asleep during the game too.
9
10   Q.    Were you feeling tired that morning?
11
12   A.    A little bit, I suppose. But I've driven
13   on less sleep before.
14
15   Q.    Do you think your level of fatigue affected
16   your driving that day?
17
18   A.    I don't think so.
19
20   Q.    But you can't rule it out?
21
22   A.    I mean, I guess anything is possible.
23
24   Q.    Let's talk about the accident itself. Can
25   you describe what happened?
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 11

1    A.    I was driving east on Atlantic Avenue,
2    approaching the intersection with Flatbush
3    Avenue. The light turned yellow, and I made
4    the decision to proceed through.
5
6    Q.    At what speed were you traveling?
7
8    A.    I'd estimate around 35 miles per hour.
9
10   Q.    What is the posted speed limit on that
11   stretch of Atlantic Avenue?
12
13   A.    I believe it's 25.
14
15   Q.    So you were traveling 10 miles per hour
16   over the speed limit?
17
18   A.    I suppose so. Traffic usually moves at
19   that speed in that area.
20
21   Q.    Did you see Ms. Martinez before the impact?
22
23   A.    I saw her at the last second. She was in
24   the crosswalk.
25
26   Q.    Was she in the crosswalk legally?

_____________________________________________________________

Page 12

1    A.    I don't know. I think she might have
2    stepped out when the signal changed.
3
4    Q.    Did you see what the pedestrian signal
5    showed at the time?
6
7    A.    No, I was focused on my light.
8
9    Q.    Did you attempt to brake?
10
11   A.    Yes, as soon as I saw her.
12
13   Q.    But it was too late?
14
15   A.    Unfortunately, yes.
16
17   Q.    You struck Ms. Martinez with your truck?
18
19   A.    Yes.
20
21   Q.    And then what happened?
22
23   A.    She went down. I stopped the truck and
24   called 911 immediately.
25
26              (Exhibit 1 marked for identification)

_____________________________________________________________

Page 23

1    Q.    Mr. Wilson, I'm showing you what's been
2    marked as Exhibit 2. Do you recognize this?
3
4    A.    It looks like phone records.
5
6    Q.    Are these your cell phone records for
7    October 14, 2025?
8
9    A.    I'd have to look more closely.
10
11   Q.    Please do.
12
13   A.    Yes, this appears to be my phone.
14
15   Q.    I direct your attention to 7:28 a.m.
16   Do you see an entry there?
17
18   A.    Yes.
19
20   Q.    What does it show?
21
22   A.    It shows a text message sent.
23
24   Q.    At 7:28 a.m. - two minutes before the
25   accident - you sent a text message?
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 24

1    A.    It appears so.
2
3    Q.    Were you texting while driving?
4
5    A.    I don't remember texting.
6
7    Q.    But your phone records show you sent a
8    text at 7:28 a.m.?
9
10   A.    Yes.
11
12   Q.    And the accident occurred at approximately
13   7:30 a.m.?
14
15   A.    Yes.
16
17   Q.    So within two minutes of the accident,
18   you were using your phone?
19
20   A.    I might have been at a red light.
21
22   Q.    But you just testified that you proceeded
23   through the yellow light at the intersection
24   where the accident occurred?
25
26   A.    That was at Flatbush. The text might have

_____________________________________________________________

Page 25

1    been at an earlier light.
2
3    Q.    Mr. Wilson, Atlantic Avenue from your
4    route that morning - how many traffic lights
5    are there between where you would have been
6    at 7:28 and the accident location?
7
8    A.    I'm not sure exactly.
9
10   Q.    Is it possible you were texting while
11   the truck was in motion?
12
13              MS. THOMPSON: Objection, calls for
14   speculation.
15
16   A.    I really don't remember. It's possible.
17   I honestly don't recall.
18
19   Q.    Who did you send the text to?
20
21   A.    I'd have to check. Probably my dispatcher
22   or my wife.
23
24   Q.    What was the content of the message?
25
26   A.    I don't remember.

1              (Exhibit 3 marked for identification)
2
3    Q.    Mr. Wilson, I'm showing you Exhibit 3,
4    which is the accident report prepared by
5    Officer Daniels of the NYPD. Have you seen
6    this before?
7
8    A.    Yes, I think I was given a copy.
9
10   Q.    I direct your attention to the section
11   titled "Driver Statement." It says here that
12   you told Officer Daniels, quote, "I didn't
13   see her until it was too late. I might have
14   been distracted." Do you recall making that
15   statement?
16
17   A.    I was pretty shook up at the time.
18
19   Q.    But do you recall saying you might have
20   been distracted?
21
22   A.    I might have said something like that.
23
24   Q.    What were you distracted by?
25
26   A.    I don't know. Maybe I was looking at

_____________________________________________________________

Page 32

1    my mirrors or checking something in the cab.
2
3    Q.    Or looking at your phone?
4
5    A.    I said I don't remember.
6
7    Q.    Let me read you another portion of the
8    officer's report. Under "Observations," it
9    states: "Driver appeared fatigued. Driver
10   admitted to starting shift at 4 AM." Did
11   Officer Daniels accurately record that?
12
13   A.    I did tell him when I started.
14
15   Q.    And he noted you appeared fatigued?
16
17   A.    I was shaken up from the accident. Anyone
18   would look fatigued after something like that.
19
20   Q.    But the accident had just occurred. You're
21   saying you went from alert to fatigued in the
22   minutes after impact?
23
24   A.    I'm saying it was a traumatic situation.
25
26   Q.    Fair enough. Let's move on.

_____________________________________________________________

Page 45

1              (Exhibit 4 marked for identification)
2
3    Q.    Mr. Wilson, I'm showing you Exhibit 4,
4    which are documents from your personnel file
5    at Acme Trucking. Do you recognize these?
6
7    A.    Yes.
8
9    Q.    I direct your attention to page 3, which
10   appears to be a disciplinary notice dated
11   June 22, 2024. Can you tell me what this is
12   about?
13
14   A.    It was a warning about hours of service
15   violations.
16
17   Q.    Can you explain what that means?
18
19   A.    I had exceeded my allowable driving hours
20   on a few occasions.
21
22   Q.    The document indicates you drove 14 hours
23   in a single shift when the maximum is 11
24   hours. Is that correct?
25
26   A.    If that's what it says.

_____________________________________________________________

Page 46

1    Q.    And there's another violation noted here
2    from March 2024, where you drove without
3    the required 10-hour rest break?
4
5    A.    Sometimes the schedule is demanding.
6
7    Q.    So you've violated federal hours of
8    service regulations on multiple occasions?
9
10   A.    I've had a couple of issues, yes.
11
12   Q.    Were you in violation of any hours of
13   service regulations on the day of the
14   accident?
15
16   A.    No, I don't believe so.
17
18   Q.    You started at 4 a.m. and the accident
19   was at 7:30 a.m. That's only three and a
20   half hours.
21
22   A.    Correct.
23
24   Q.    But you had only three hours of sleep.
25   Are there regulations about rest before a
26   shift?

_____________________________________________________________

Page 47

1    A.    There are recommended guidelines.
2
3    Q.    And what do those guidelines recommend?
4
5    A.    I'm not sure of the exact numbers.
6
7    Q.    Is it your understanding that drivers
8    should be well-rested before operating a
9    commercial vehicle?
10
11   A.    Of course.
12
13   Q.    And you were not well-rested on October
14   14, 2025?
15
16   A.    I was tired, but I've driven tired before.
17   Most drivers have.
18
19   Q.    Does Acme Trucking have any policies
20   about driving while fatigued?
21
22   A.    I'm sure there's something in the
23   handbook.
24
25   Q.    But you don't follow it?
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 48

1              MS. THOMPSON: Objection,
2    argumentative.
3
4    A.    I try to follow company policies.
5
6    Q.    But you drove on three hours of sleep
7    and struck a pedestrian?
8
9              MS. THOMPSON: Objection, compound
10   and argumentative.
11
12   A.    The accident wasn't because I was tired.
13
14   Q.    What was it because of?
15
16   A.    She stepped out in front of me. I didn't
17   have time to stop.
18
19   Q.    Even though you were going 10 miles over
20   the speed limit, possibly texting, and
21   running on three hours of sleep?
22
23              MS. THOMPSON: Objection, assumes
24   facts not in evidence, argumentative.
25
26   A.    I didn't do anything wrong intentionally.

_____________________________________________________________

Page 52

1              (Exhibit 5 marked for identification)
2
3    Q.    Mr. Wilson, Exhibit 5 appears to be your
4    training records from Acme Trucking. When
5    did you last complete a safety training
6    course?
7
8    A.    I'd have to look at the records.
9
10   Q.    Please do.
11
12   A.    It looks like March 2023.
13
14   Q.    So almost three years before the accident?
15
16   A.    Training isn't required every year.
17
18   Q.    I see a notation here that indicates
19   refresher training was recommended in
20   January 2025 but was listed as "deferred
21   due to scheduling." Can you explain that?
22
23   A.    We were short-staffed. It was hard to
24   get time off for training.
25
26   Q.    Whose decision was it to defer your

_____________________________________________________________

Page 53

1    training?
2
3    A.    Management, I guess. Dispatch schedules
4    the training.
5
6    Q.    So Acme Trucking allowed you to continue
7    driving without completing recommended
8    safety training?
9
10   A.    I was still qualified. The training
11   wasn't mandatory.
12
13   Q.    Was distracted driving covered in your
14   last training?
15
16   A.    Probably. I don't remember specifics.
17
18   Q.    Was fatigue management covered?
19
20   A.    Yes, I believe so.
21
22   Q.    And yet here we are.
23
24              MS. THOMPSON: Is there a question?
25
26              MR. CHEN: I'll move on.

_____________________________________________________________

Page 58

1    Q.    Mr. Wilson, are you aware of Ms. Martinez's
2    injuries as a result of this accident?
3
4    A.    I know she was hurt.
5
6    Q.    She suffered a fractured pelvis, a
7    traumatic brain injury, multiple broken
8    ribs, and internal bleeding. Were you
9    aware of the extent of her injuries?
10
11   A.    No, I didn't know all of that.
12
13   Q.    She was in the hospital for three weeks
14   and has undergone four surgeries.
15
16   A.    I'm sorry to hear that.
17
18   Q.    She may never walk normally again.
19
20   A.    That's terrible. I never wanted anyone
21   to get hurt.
22
23   Q.    But your actions that day - the speeding,
24   the possible texting, the fatigue - those
25   contributed to her injuries?
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 59

1              MS. THOMPSON: Objection, calls for
2    a legal conclusion.
3
4    A.    I made a mistake. I should have been
5    more careful.
6
7    Q.    What mistake specifically?
8
9    A.    I shouldn't have tried to make the yellow
10   light. I should have stopped.
11
12   Q.    Anything else?
13
14   A.    I don't know. Maybe I should have gotten
15   more sleep.
16
17   Q.    Maybe?
18
19   A.    Yes. I should have gotten more sleep.
20
21   Q.    And the texting?
22
23   A.    I don't remember texting while driving.
24
25   Q.    But you can't rule it out?
26

_____________________________________________________________

Page 60

1    A.    I can't say for certain one way or the
2    other.
3
4    Q.    If you were texting while driving a
5    commercial truck on three hours of sleep at
6    10 miles over the speed limit, would you
7    agree that would be reckless?
8
9              MS. THOMPSON: Objection, calls for
10   a legal conclusion, hypothetical.
11
12   A.    That would be bad judgment, yes.
13
14   Q.    Bad judgment that could seriously injure
15   or kill someone?
16
17   A.    Yes.
18
19   Q.    And that's exactly what happened here?
20
21   A.    Yes.
22
23              MR. CHEN: Thank you. I have no
24   further questions at this time.
25
26              (Recess taken)
