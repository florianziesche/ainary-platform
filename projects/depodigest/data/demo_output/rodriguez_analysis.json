  "executive_summary": "Carlos Rodriguez provides powerful corroborating testimony for the plaintiff's case. As an independent eyewitness with no connection to either party, his observations carry significant weight.\n\nKey findings: Rodriguez confirms that Ms. Martinez had the walk signal and was legally in the crosswalk. He observed the truck run the red light without stopping. Most critically, he saw the driver's head down—appearing to look at something in his lap—immediately before impact. He heard the driver admit at the scene: 'I didn't see her' and 'I was already running late. My dispatcher is going to kill me.'\n\nRodriguez's testimony directly contradicts any defense theory that Martinez was at fault or that the driver was paying attention to the road. His observations about the driver's fatigue ('His eyes were red, like he hadn't slept much') corroborate the fatigue evidence from Wilson's own deposition.",
  "narrative_summary": "Carlos Rodriguez was waiting at the bus stop on the corner of Atlantic and Flatbush on the morning of October 14, 2025, at approximately 7:30 AM. He was on his way to work and was watching the intersection because he was considering crossing there himself.\n\nRodriguez observed Maria Martinez begin crossing Atlantic Avenue in the crosswalk. He specifically noted that the pedestrian walk signal was solid white (not flashing), indicating she had just received the signal to cross and was legally in the crosswalk.\n\nAs Martinez crossed, Rodriguez saw a commercial truck traveling east on Atlantic Avenue approach the intersection. According to Rodriguez, the truck was traveling at approximately 35-40 mph—significantly over the 25 mph speed limit. The traffic light for Atlantic Avenue was red.\n\nMost significantly, Rodriguez observed that the driver's head was down immediately before the impact. 'He was looking down, like he was looking at something in his lap. Maybe a phone.' Rodriguez noted that the driver's head was down for 'at least a few seconds' before the collision.\n\nThe truck struck Martinez without any apparent attempt to stop. Rodriguez did not hear any horn or brake sounds before impact. After the collision, the truck continued for 20-30 feet before stopping.\n\nRodriguez approached the scene and spoke briefly with the driver. He heard the driver say 'I didn't see her' and 'I was already running late. My dispatcher is going to kill me.' Rodriguez also observed that the driver 'looked tired' with 'red eyes, like he hadn't slept much.'\n\nRodriguez remained at the scene and provided a statement to the responding police officer.",

    "settlement_range_adjustment": "+15-20%",
    "reasoning": "Rodriguez's testimony as an independent eyewitness significantly strengthens the plaintiff's case beyond what was established in Wilson's own deposition. His observations corroborate every key element of plaintiff's theory: Martinez was crossing legally, Wilson was distracted (head down), Wilson was speeding, Wilson ran the red light, and Wilson made admissions at the scene.\n\nThe fact that Rodriguez has no connection to either party and no financial interest in the outcome makes his testimony particularly valuable. Juries tend to credit independent eyewitnesses, especially when their observations align with other evidence.\n\nRodriguez's observation that the driver's 'head was down' provides visual corroboration for the cell phone records showing texting two minutes before impact. His testimony about the driver looking tired with 'red eyes' corroborates the fatigue evidence.\n\nThis deposition eliminates any viable defense theory that Martinez was at fault or that Wilson was operating his vehicle safely. Combined with Wilson's own damaging admissions, the case for liability is now overwhelming."
