Rodriguez is an independent witness with no stake in the outcome—he doesn't know either party and has not been promised anything for his testimony. Wilson, as the defendant, has obvious motivation to minimize his fault. Rodriguez's testimony has remained consistent and is corroborated by physical evidence (the walk signal timing, the cell phone records). Wilson's testimony contains internal contradictions (sleep duration) and is contradicted by documentary evidence (texting before accident). Rodriguez was a neutral observer; Wilson is trying to avoid liability.",

  "key_impeachment_opportunities": [
    "Wilson claims light was yellow; Rodriguez says it was red. Use physics: if walk signal was on (Rodriguez confirms), traffic light must be red.",
    "Wilson claims he 'saw her at the last second'; Rodriguez saw Wilson's head down looking at lap. He couldn't have seen her if he wasn't looking.",
    "Wilson claims he braked immediately; Rodriguez heard no brakes. Corroborates that Wilson never saw Martinez coming.",
    "Wilson tries to minimize 'distracted' statement; Rodriguez independently heard 'I didn't see her' corroborating distraction.",
    "Wilson's speeding is now indisputable - both witnesses agree on 35+ mph in 25 zone."
  ],
  "strategic_summary": "The comparison of Wilson's and Rodriguez's depositions devastates the defense case. On every contested issue, the independent eyewitness contradicts the defendant's self-serving testimony:\n\n1. **Traffic Signal**: Wilson claims yellow; Rodriguez confirms red. Rodriguez wins—he has no reason to lie, and the walk signal being on proves the light was red.\n\n2. **Driver Attention**: Wilson implies he was watching the road; Rodriguez saw his head down. Rodriguez's observation explains both the cell phone records and Wilson's 'I didn't see her' admission.\n\n3. **Braking**: Wilson claims he braked immediately; Rodriguez heard nothing. This corroborates that Wilson never saw Martinez because he was distracted.\n\nMeanwhile, both witnesses agree on facts that hurt the defense: speeding (35+ in 25 zone), Martinez in crosswalk, driver appeared fatigued.\n\n**Trial Strategy**: Call Rodriguez first to establish the facts through a credible, independent witness. Then call Wilson and systematically impeach his testimony using Rodriguez's observations. The jury will see Wilson as either a liar or so distracted he doesn't remember what happened—either way, he loses.\n\n**Settlement Impact**: This comparison eliminates any viable defense. The case should be valued assuming full liability. Focus negotiations on damages, not liability."
