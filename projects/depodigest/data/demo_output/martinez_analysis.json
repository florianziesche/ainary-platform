  "witness": {
    "name": "James Wilson",
    "role": "Defendant - Commercial Truck Driver",
    "credibility_assessment": "Witness credibility is significantly compromised. Wilson provided inconsistent statements about his sleep duration (first claiming 4-5 hours, then admitting times that calculate to approximately 3 hours). He was evasive about texting while driving, claiming he 'doesn't remember' despite phone records showing a text sent 2 minutes before impact. His demeanor shifted notably when confronted with documentary evidence, becoming defensive and vague.",
    "demeanor_notes": "Became defensive and evasive when confronted with cell phone records. Frequently used phrases like 'I don't remember' and 'I guess' when pressed on critical details.",
    "key_weaknesses": [
      "Admitted to only 3 hours of sleep before operating commercial vehicle",
      "Cannot explain or deny texting 2 minutes before accident",
      "Prior disciplinary record for hours-of-service violations",
      "Admitted to driving 10 mph over speed limit",
      "Told officer at scene he was 'distracted'",
      "Safety training was deferred and not completed"
    ],
    "key_strengths": [
      "15 years of driving experience with only one serious accident",
      "Expressed genuine remorse for the incident",
      "Immediately called 911 after the accident",
      "No evidence of alcohol or drug impairment"
    ]
  },
  "executive_summary": "This deposition provides exceptionally strong evidence for the plaintiff's case. Defendant James Wilson made multiple critical admissions that establish negligence and severely damage his credibility.\n\nKey findings: Wilson admitted to operating a commercial truck on approximately 3 hours of sleep after staying up late watching a baseball game. Cell phone records prove he sent a text message just 2 minutes before striking the plaintiff. He was traveling 10 mph over the posted speed limit. At the scene, Wilson told the responding officer he 'might have been distracted,' and the officer noted Wilson 'appeared fatigued.'\n\nWilson's employment file reveals prior disciplinary actions for hours-of-service violations, and his safety training was deferred and never completed before the accident. These facts establish a pattern of disregard for safety regulations.\n\nThe combination of fatigue, distracted driving (texting), speeding, and inadequate training creates a compelling case for negligence.",
  "narrative_summary": "On October 14, 2025, at approximately 7:30 AM, James Wilson was operating a commercial truck for Acme Trucking when he struck pedestrian Maria Martinez in a crosswalk at the intersection of Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nWilson began his shift at 4:00 AM after getting only about 3 hours of sleep. He had stayed up until after midnight watching a Yankees playoff game the night before. Despite feeling 'a little bit' tired, Wilson chose to drive anyway.\n\nAs Wilson approached the intersection, the traffic light turned yellow. Rather than stopping, Wilson decided to proceed through while traveling at approximately 35 mph in a 25 mph zone. He testified that he saw Ms. Martinez 'at the last second' in the crosswalk before impact.\n\nCell phone records show Wilson sent a text message at 7:28 AM—just two minutes before the accident. When asked about this, Wilson claimed he 'doesn't remember texting.'\n\nMs. Martinez suffered severe injuries including a fractured pelvis, traumatic brain injury, multiple broken ribs, and internal bleeding. She was hospitalized for three weeks and has undergone four surgeries.",
