## Demo Flow

### 1. Upload & Analyze (3 min)

**Action:** Show the clean upload interface

"The interface is simple. Upload your transcript—we support PDF and text files—or paste it directly. Let me load our sample case."

**Action:** Click "Load Sample Deposition"

"This is a real-world PI scenario: Martinez v. Acme Trucking. Pedestrian struck by a commercial truck. The defendant driver gave his deposition last month. Let's see what we find."

**Action:** Show loading animation briefly, then results

---

### 2. Executive Summary (2 min)

**Action:** Navigate to Analysis tab

"First, you get the big picture. The executive summary tells you immediately: is this a strong deposition for your case?"

**Key Quote to Read:**
> "This deposition provides exceptionally strong evidence for the plaintiff's case. The defendant made multiple critical admissions establishing negligence and severely damaging his credibility."

"In 30 seconds, you know this deposition moved the needle. But let's drill into the specifics."

---

### 3. Key Admissions (4 min)

**Action:** Navigate to Admissions tab

"This is where it gets powerful. We've extracted every significant admission, categorized by type and severity, with exact page and line citations."

**Walk through top admissions:**

1. **Sleep Admission (Critical)**
   - "The driver first claimed 4-5 hours of sleep. But look at this—when you do the math on the times he provided, it's only 3 hours."
   - "That's a critical admission. AND a credibility problem."

2. **Texting Evidence (Critical)**
   - "Cell phone records show a text at 7:28 AM. Accident at 7:30 AM. Two minutes."
   - "When asked about it, he says 'I don't remember.' But then offers an explanation. Pick one—you remember or you don't."

3. **Scene Statement (Critical)**
   - "The best evidence is often what they said before they lawyered up. Here, he told the officer at the scene: 'I might have been distracted.'"
   - "That contemporaneous admission is gold."

**Filter Demo:**
"You can filter by severity—show me just the critical admissions—or by type—show me everything on negligence."

---

### 4. Contradictions (2 min)

**Action:** Show Contradictions section

"Internal contradictions are impeachment gold. We found three in this deposition."

**Highlight the sleep contradiction:**
- Statement 1: "4-5 hours of sleep"
- Statement 2: Times that calculate to 3 hours
- "You can't have it both ways. Either he's bad at math or he's not being truthful."

---

### 5. Cross-Examination Strategy (3 min)

**Action:** Navigate to Cross-Exam tab

"Now here's where we really earn our keep. Most tools stop at 'here's what they said.' We go further—how do you USE it at trial?"

**Show impeachment points:**
"These are your ammunition. Seven ready-to-use impeachment points."

**Show a question card:**
"Look at this question structure. We give you:
- The exact question to ask (leading, yes/no)
- The purpose—what you're establishing
- The page/line reference
- AND—if they admit, here's your follow-up. If they deny, here's how to impeach."

"This is trial prep, not just summarization."

---

### 6. Settlement Impact Score (3 min)

**Action:** Navigate to Settlement tab

"Finally—and this is what no one else offers—we assess how this deposition affects your case value."

**Show the score card:**
- Overall Score: 82/100
- Settlement Adjustment: +25-35%

"This defendant's deposition didn't just establish liability. It increased the case value by an estimated 25-35%."

**Walk through factors:**
- "Multiple concurrent negligent acts"
- "Contemporaneous admission of distraction"
- "Documentary evidence of phone use"
- "Prior disciplinary history"
- "Credibility damage from contradictions"

**Read key reasoning:**
"The system explains its reasoning. This isn't a black box. You can use this analysis in settlement negotiations: 'Your client admitted X, Y, and Z. Here's why that increases our demand.'"

## Common Questions

**Q: How accurate are the citations?**
A: "We extract page and line numbers directly from the transcript format. Standard transcripts work perfectly. If yours uses non-standard formatting, we can adjust."

**Q: What about confidentiality?**
A: "Your transcripts are processed securely and never used to train models. We can sign your firm's NDA."

**Q: Can I edit the output?**
A: "Everything exports to Word and PDF. You can edit, add your own notes, and use it directly in your case file."

**Q: Do you integrate with case management?**
A: "We're building Clio and Filevine integrations. For now, it's export and import."
