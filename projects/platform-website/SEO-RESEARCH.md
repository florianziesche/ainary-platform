### 1.3 TRENDING AI TERMS (2025-2026) - MUST INTEGRATE

**Source: Forbes, IBM, Gartner, Google Cloud AI Trends Report 2026**

| Term | Trend Status | Integration Priority | Usage Context |
|------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Agentic AI** | 🔥 Peak hype | **HIGH** | Describe our 5-agent architecture |
| **Multi-agent systems** | 🔥 Growing fast | **HIGH** | Technical differentiation |
| **AI agents** | 🔥 Mainstream | **HIGH** | Throughout site, product descriptions |
| **Autonomous workflows** | ↗️ Rising | MEDIUM | Value proposition |
| **AI orchestration** | ↗️ Rising | MEDIUM | How it works section |
| **Enterprise AI adoption** | → Steady | MEDIUM | Industry context |
| **Predictive intelligence** | → Established | MEDIUM | CB Insights uses this heavily |
| **GenAI applications** | → Mature | LOW | Generic, oversaturated |
| **AI governance** | ↗️ Rising | MEDIUM | Quality/trust positioning |

**Gartner Stat (2026):** *"40% of enterprise applications will embed task-specific AI agents by 2026"*  
**Usage:** Lead with this on homepage to establish timeliness and credibility.

**Key Insight:** Competitors like CB Insights use "Predictive Intelligence" while AlphaSense emphasizes "GenAI." Ainary should own **"Agentic AI Intelligence"** as unique positioning.

---

## 2. Competitor SEO Analysis

### 2.1 CB Insights (cbinsights.com)

**Title Tag Analysis:**
```
"CB Insights — Predictive Intelligence on Private Companies" (58 chars)
```

**Meta Description (inferred from content):**
- Focus on "predictive intelligence" (their branded term)
- Emphasize "private companies" and "early signals"
- Strong social proof: "Trusted by 10 largest businesses, All Big 4, 86% of software companies"

**SEO Strengths:**
- ✅ Strong branded positioning ("Predictive Intelligence")
- ✅ Heavy use of trust signals (customer logos, stats)
- ✅ Clear value prop: "see opportunity before the market does"
- ✅ Use cases tied to outcomes: "2.8x more acquisitions, 6x more investments"

**SEO Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Heavy reliance on brand, less focus on product keywords
- ❌ Generic "private companies" vs specific "AI-powered"
- ❌ Minimal mention of AI/automation (outdated positioning?)

**Ainary Opportunity:** CB Insights positions as "intelligence" but doesn't emphasize AI agents or automation. We can win on "AI-powered" and "agentic" positioning.

### 2.2 AlphaSense (alpha-sense.com)

**Title Tag:**
```
"AlphaSense | Market Intelligence and Search Platform" (54 chars)
```

**Meta Description (inferred):**
- "Enterprise-grade platform with GenAI"
- "500+ million premium documents"
- Focus on "trusted insights" and "no hallucinations"

**SEO Strengths:**
- ✅ Emphasizes "GenAI" and AI capabilities
- ✅ Massive content library as differentiator (500M+ docs)
- ✅ Trust messaging: "sentence-level citations, no hallucinations"
- ✅ Multi-agent architecture mentioned (new feature)

**SEO Weaknesses:**
- ❌ "Search Platform" undersells the intelligence capability
- ❌ Less clear on specific use cases (company analysis, due diligence)
- ❌ Heavy focus on financial services, less on consultants/executives

**Ainary Opportunity:** AlphaSense is search-first. We're **reports-first** (actionable outputs vs search results). Position as "AI analysts, not AI search."

### 2.3 Crunchbase (crunchbase.com)

**Title Tag:**
```
"Crunchbase" (10 chars - minimal branding only)
```

**SEO Strengths:**
- ✅ Massive domain authority and backlinks
- ✅ Default source for startup data (network effect)
- ✅ Free tier drives organic traffic

**SEO Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Weak SEO optimization (minimal title/description)
- ❌ Database, not intelligence (raw data vs insights)
- ❌ No AI positioning or analysis layer

**Ainary Opportunity:** Crunchbase is data. We're **intelligence**. Position as "what to do with the data" not just "here's the data."

### 2.4 Competitive Keyword Gap Analysis

| Keyword | CB Insights | AlphaSense | Crunchbase | Ainary Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| AI company analysis | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **Own this** |
| Agentic AI | ❌ | ✅ (new) | ❌ | ✅ **Own this** |
| Due diligence automation | ❌ | Partial | ❌ | ✅ **Own this** |
| Predictive intelligence | ✅ Branded | ❌ | ❌ | Acknowledge but don't compete |
| Multi-agent | ❌ | ✅ (new) | ❌ | ✅ Emphasize more |
| Daily intelligence brief | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **Own this** |
| Confidence indicators | ❌ | Partial | ❌ | ✅ **Unique feature** |

**Strategic Takeaway:** None of the major competitors own "AI company analysis tool" or "agentic AI intelligence." This is our positioning wedge.
