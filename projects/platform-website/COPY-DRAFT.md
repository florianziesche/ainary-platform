## [HERO]

**Headline:**
I build AI that works in production. Not in demos.

**Body:**
Strategy, architecture, and deployment for companies where AI replaces workflows — not just tasks. Manufacturing. Legal. Enterprise operations.

Former startup CEO. Raised €5.5M+. Shipped AI systems to BMW, Siemens, and Bosch. Five years of building what works, at enterprise scale.

## [SERVICES]

**Section label:** Services

**AI Strategy & Deployment**
End-to-end AI implementation for manufacturers and enterprises. From architecture to production. I've built RAG systems with <0.2% hallucination rates and multi-agent workflows that run unsupervised. I stay until it works.

**Tools for Operators**
Production-grade software validated against real data. CNC Planner Pro — manufacturing cost calculation within ±10% of ERP benchmarks. AI workflow templates and automation tools. Built by a builder, for builders. → cnc-planer.de

**Writing & Advisory**
Applied AI through the lens of someone who ships it. Essays, workshops, and founder advisory. VC Lab Fellow (Decile Group) — I evaluate AI startups and write about what separates real from hype. → Substack

## [CASE STUDIES]

**Section label:** Work

**36ZERO Vision — Scaling AI to Automotive**
Built a cloud computer vision platform for quality inspection. Clients: BMW, Siemens, Bosch, Magna. Grew total contract value 200%+ in one year. Raised €5.5M+ across equity and grants. Managed P&L in a 150-person organization.

**CNC Planner Pro — Manufacturing Intelligence**
6,100+ lines of code. Cost calculator for CNC manufacturing — validated against real ERP data. Generates quotes, time calculations, and process recommendations in seconds. → cnc-planer.de

**Legal AI — Accuracy Where It Matters**
Multi-agent system for legal research. Four specialized agents: Questioner, Researcher, Validator, Reporter. Hallucination rate below 0.2%. Built for high-stakes environments where "close enough" isn't.

**The Evolution Experiment**
84 AI agents designing their own improvement protocol. Weekly experiments producing novel frameworks for human-AI collaboration. Published research, unique in the industry.

## [RESOURCES]

**Section label:** Resources

**Due Diligence Framework for AI Startups**
The technical checklist I use to evaluate AI companies. Architecture, data moats, hallucination testing, unit economics. From evaluating dozens of startups as a VC Lab Fellow.

**AI Readiness Assessment**
A structured framework for enterprises: where AI creates ROI, what to skip, and how to measure before you spend.

**Founder's AI Stack 2026**
The exact tools, models, and workflows I run daily. Claude, n8n, Obsidian, custom agents. Coming soon.

## [PERSPECTIVE]

**Section label:** Perspective

**Headline:**
Where AI meets scarce expertise.

**Body:**
The $11 trillion global labor market is 24× the size of the $450 billion software market. The biggest AI opportunity is not better chatbots. It is replacing entire workflows in industries where expertise is scarce and labor is expensive.

Vertical AI beats horizontal AI. The moat is domain knowledge encoded into systems — not model performance. The best AI products are built by people who have worked in the industries they are automating.

I have built from both sides. As a startup CEO shipping computer vision to automotive OEMs, and as an operator scaling a 150-person organization. The pattern holds: operators build better AI. And the bridge between European industrial depth and American market scale is an arbitrage that compounds over time.

# SELF-REVIEW: Was ist an diesem Text gut/schlecht?

## Gut:
- Jeder Satz ist eine Aussage, keine Frage
- Zahlen sind konkret (€5.5M, 200%, <0.2%, $11T)
- Kein Marketing-Speak ("innovative solutions", "leveraging AI")
- Client-Namen (BMW etc.) sind Social Proof ohne eigene Section
- Services haben klare Scope-Definition

## Noch nicht gut genug:
- Hero-Headline ist safe. "Works in production, not demos" — hab ich schon 3x verwendet. Braucht etwas Unerwartetes.
- "Former startup CEO" als zweiter Satz im Hero — zu CV-artig. Conviction startet nie mit Credentials.
- Case Studies lesen sich wie CV-Bullets, nicht wie Stories. Kein Narrativ, kein Problem→Lösung.
- Perspective ist gut aber klingt wie ein Blog-Auszug, nicht wie eine Überzeugung die einem den Atem nimmt.
- Resources sind generisch. "AI Readiness Assessment" könnte auf jeder Berater-Website stehen.

## Was fehlt:
- Eine Aussage die nur ICH machen kann. Was ist Florians unique voice?
- Tension/Provokation. Conviction sagt "We have the courage of our convictions." Founders Fund hat ein ganzes Manifesto. Was ist Florians?
- Die "So What?" Frage. Warum sollte jemand nach 3 Sekunden weiterlesen?
