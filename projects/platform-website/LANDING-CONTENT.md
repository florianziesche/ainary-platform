### Tab 1: Strategic Intelligence

**Badge:** INSIGHT REPORT
**Title:** Strategic Intelligence Report

**Executive Summary:**
Strategic analysis reveals three overlooked growth vectors. Current market positioning undervalues core IP by an estimated 30%. Two competitors are quietly building in the same space — the window to act is narrowing.

**KPIs:**
| Value | Label |
|-------|-------|
| $2.4B | Addressable Market Gap |
| 30% | IP Undervaluation |
| 18 mo | Market Window |

**Key Recommendations:**
1. Untapped licensing revenue → $340M/yr potential
2. Supply chain restructure → 22% cost reduction
3. Adjacent market entry via existing IP → first-mover

**Hidden Insights:**
- Surprising: Patent portfolio overlaps with autonomous logistics — nobody in IR materials mentions this.
- Contrarian: Consensus says mature market. Our data shows 3 emerging sub-segments growing 40%+ YoY.

**Strategic Risks:**
- Two stealth competitors identified in adjacent space
- Key executive departures signal internal strategic shift
- Regulatory tailwind may reverse in 12-18 months

### Tab 2: Due Diligence

**Badge:** DUE DILIGENCE
**Title:** Arclight AI — Due Diligence Report

**Company Overview:**
Arclight AI builds autonomous agent orchestration for enterprise workflows. Their platform enables non-technical teams to deploy AI agents for procurement, compliance, and operations. Strong technical team, growing enterprise pipeline, but unit economics remain unproven at scale.

**KPIs:**
| Value | Label |
|-------|-------|
| $14.2M | Total Raised |
| 340% | YoY Growth |
| Series B | Current Round |

**Confidence Assessment:**
| Area | Score | Detail |
|------|-------|--------|
| Team & Leadership | ●●● High | 3 ex-FAANG engineers, repeat founders |
| Market Opportunity | ●●● High | $47B TAM, validated by Gartner |
| Product-Market Fit | ●●○ Medium | 12 enterprise pilots, 3 converted |
| Unit Economics | ●○○ Low | LTV/CAC ratio unclear, burn rate high |
| Competitive Moat | ●●○ Medium | Patent pending, but replicable |

**Hidden Signal:**
CTO's GitHub activity dropped 80% in last 30 days. Potential departure risk or stealth project pivot.

## In a World of Noise

**Heading:** In a world of noise, we deliver what matters.

**Body:**
I spent 5 years building AI companies. The best decisions don't come from more data — they come from better synthesis. Now I want to help other companies unlock the same potential. We find what others miss, write about it from an operator's perspective, and build tools that make strategic intelligence accessible to everyone.

— Florian Ziesche, Founder
