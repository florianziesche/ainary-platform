    "prompt": "Abstract cosmic visualization of a binary star system merging with digital binary code. Two luminous bodies orbiting each other in deep space, connected by streams of light and data. Binary digits (0s and 1s) flowing like cosmic waves across the scene. Color palette: predominantly black background with white/silver light particles and subtle warm gold accents. Ultra-wide cinematic composition. No text, no watermarks. Photorealistic lighting with abstract elements. The aesthetic of deep space photography meets data visualization.",
