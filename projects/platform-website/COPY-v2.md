Florian Ziesche
AI Consultant · Builder · VC Lab Fellow

Most AI projects fail in deployment, not in demos.
I make sure yours doesn't.

## [SERVICES]

Services

**AI Strategy & Deployment**
You have a business problem. I turn it into a working AI system. Architecture, build, deployment — I stay until it runs in production without me.
*Proof: Built RAG system with <0.2% hallucination rate. Grew enterprise AI revenue 200%+ in one year. Clients: BMW, Siemens, Bosch.*

**Tools & Products**
Software I've built to solve problems I've seen firsthand. CNC Planner Pro calculates manufacturing costs within ±10% of ERP benchmarks — in seconds, not hours. More tools coming.
→ cnc-planer.de

**Writing & Advisory**
I evaluate AI startups as a VC Lab Fellow. I write about what's real and what isn't. If you're a founder, I'll tell you what I'd want to hear as an investor — not what's comfortable.

## [WORK]

Work

**36ZERO Vision**
Cloud computer vision for automotive quality inspection. I built the product, then scaled the business. BMW, Siemens, Bosch, Magna, Linamar as clients. €5.5M+ raised. 200%+ contract value growth in 12 months. 150-person organization, full P&L responsibility.

**CNC Planner Pro**
Manufacturing costs are calculated by gut feeling or bloated ERP systems. I built a tool that does it in seconds — 6,100 lines of code, validated against real production data. Now in pilot with manufacturers.
→ cnc-planer.de

**Legal AI**
Legal research where hallucination isn't an option. Four-agent architecture: one asks, one searches, one validates, one reports. Below 0.2% hallucination rate. Built because I wanted to prove RAG can work in high-stakes domains.

**The Evolution Experiment**
What happens when you give 84 AI agents the task of designing their own improvement? You get protocols that no human would have written. Weekly experiments, published openly. The most unusual project in my portfolio — and the one that teaches me the most.

## [RESOURCES]

Resources — Free frameworks I use and share.

**AI Due Diligence Checklist**
How I evaluate AI startups: architecture depth, data moats, hallucination rates, scaling economics, team DNA. The same checklist I use as a VC Lab Fellow, available to founders and investors.

**AI Readiness Assessment**
Before you hire a consultant or buy a tool: is your business actually ready for AI? Where is the ROI real, and where is it a slide deck? A structured framework to answer that honestly.

**The Operator's AI Stack 2026**
Every tool, model, and workflow I run daily to build multiple products as a solo operator. From Claude to n8n. Coming soon.

## [PERSPECTIVE]

Perspective

**Most people talk about AI. I deploy it.**

The $11 trillion global labor market is 24× larger than the $450 billion software market. The opportunity isn't chatbots. It's replacing entire process chains in industries where expertise is scarce, labor is expensive, and the workforce is aging.

Manufacturing. Legal. Healthcare. Construction. These industries don't need AI features. They need AI architectures that understand their domain — built by people who've spent years inside them, not weeks studying them.

I've spent five years doing exactly this. First building, then scaling, then shipping AI to the most demanding customers in automotive and manufacturing. The lesson is always the same: operators build better AI. Domain knowledge compounds. And the gap between European industrial depth and American market scale is an arbitrage almost nobody is positioned to capture.

That's where I work.

3. SERVICES: Jetzt mit Proof (Zahlen, Kunden) direkt integriert.
4. CASE STUDIES: Narrativ statt Bullets. Problem → Was ich tat → Resultat.
5. PERSPECTIVE: Startet mit Provokation ("Most people talk. I deploy."), endet mit "That's where I work."
6. RESOURCES: Spezifischer. "AI Due Diligence Checklist" > "Due Diligence Framework".
7. ABOUT: Narrativ statt CV. "Five years building AI companies." als Opener.
