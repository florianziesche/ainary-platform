# MISSION.md — Ainary: Why We Exist

*Internal compass. Not for the website (yet).*

---

## Mission

**Deliver insights nobody else has. Help people make better decisions. Keep everyone informed.**

We don't replace humans — we multiply them. A consultant with Ainary does in 3 minutes what used to take 3 days. A VC analyst walks into Investment Committee with a report that would have taken a team a week. A founder understands their competitive landscape without a $50K budget.

## Vision

**HUMAN × AI + COMPOUNDING KNOWLEDGE**

Three words, one principle:
- **HUMAN × AI** — Not AI instead of humans. AI as a multiplier. The consultant stays. The analyst stays. They just become 10x faster.
- **COMPOUNDING KNOWLEDGE** — Every report makes the next one smarter. Every user makes the system better. Every day, the gap between us and everyone else grows.

## What We Are

An **Intelligence Engine**. We synthesize, interpret, and deliver meaning — not just data.

- Database says: "BMW Revenue: €148.7B"
- We say: "BMW's revenue is resilient but margins are under pressure from EV transition. Here are 3 risks you should care about, ranked by likelihood and impact."

The difference: **Data tells you what happened. Intelligence tells you what it means.**

## What We Are NOT

- ❌ A database (CB Insights, Crunchbase have more data — that's fine)
- ❌ A search engine (AlphaSense indexes 500M documents — we don't compete on volume)
- ❌ A financial data provider (Bloomberg/PitchBook own that market)
- ❌ A replacement for human judgment (we inform it, not replace it)

## Our Limits (Honest)

1. We use public sources — we don't have proprietary datasets (yet)
2. We can't replace a 3-month due diligence process
3. Our accuracy depends on source quality — and we're honest about confidence levels
4. We're one tool, not the whole toolkit

**"Weniger Daten aber ehrlich" is the feature, not the bug.**

## Positioning: Complementary, Not Competitive

We are a **partner**, not a replacement:

| Who | Without Ainary | With Ainary |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| Consultant | 3 days research | 3 minutes research, 3 days strategy |
| VC Analyst | Week of DD prep | Report in minutes, focus on judgment |
| Founder | $50K for competitive intel | Self-serve, instant, honest |
| Board Member | Relies on management's narrative | Independent intelligence layer |

**"Your intelligence partner, not your replacement."**

## The Killer Question

> "A VC analyst has 30 minutes before Investment Committee. What does she need?"
> 
> Not a database. Not 500M documents. Not a ChatGPT conversation.
> She needs: **A clear assessment with sources and confidence levels.**
> 
> That's us.

## Products

## Our Moat

Not data. Competitors have more.

**Synthesis + Honesty + Compound Learning.**

1. **Synthesis** — 5 agents think about your company from different angles, then critique each other
2. **Honesty** — Confidence levels on every claim. "We don't know" is a valid answer
3. **Compound** — Your 10th report is smarter than your 1st. The system learns patterns across users, industries, time

This compounds. Every day we run, the gap grows. Someone starting tomorrow is already behind.

## For Florian + Mia

This is our compass. When we're unsure what to build next, we ask:
- Does this make decisions better?
- Does this compound?
- Does this multiply humans, not replace them?

If yes → build it.
If no → skip it.
