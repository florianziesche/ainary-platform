## Issues Found

### 1. ❌ **50% of Links Are Non-Functional Placeholders**
**Impact:** Critical — Half the website is not navigable

**Affected links (109 total):**
- All "Log in" / "Sign up" links → `#`
- All "Daily Brief" footer links → `#` (except on daily-brief.html itself)
- All "Documentation", "API" links → `#`
- All "About", "Careers", "Contact" links → `#`
- All "Privacy", "Terms", "Imprint" links → `#`
- Most CTA buttons → `#`
- Archive day links → `#`
- Signal cards "Read full analysis" → `#`
- Article/blog card containers → `#`

**Recommendation:** 
- Replace `#` with actual destinations or remove links
- Create placeholder pages (e.g., "coming-soon.html")
- Or remove links until pages exist

---

### 2. ❌ **64 Broken Links to Non-Existent Pages**
**Impact:** High — Users hit 404 errors

**Examples:**
- `/login`, `/signup`, `/try-xray`, `/sample-report`
- `/about`, `/careers`, `/contact`
- `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/security`

**These paths don't exist.** Either:
- Create the pages, or
- Change to relative paths (e.g., `login.html`), or
- Change to `#` placeholders

---

### 3. ⚠️ **Inconsistent Navigation**
**Impact:** Medium — Confusing user experience

**Issues:**
- `quality.html` uses `/login` and `/signup` (broken)
- Other pages use `#` for auth links
- `quality.html` has "How We Build" in footer, others don't
- `daily-brief.html` footer correctly links to `daily-brief.html`, others use `#`

**Recommendation:** 
- Standardize nav/footer across ALL pages
- Use shared HTML template or component

---

### 4. ⚠️ **"Daily Brief" Inconsistency**
**Impact:** Medium — Navigation confusion

**Current state:**
- Nav links to `daily-brief.html` ✅
- But Footer "Daily Brief" links to `#` on most pages ⚠️
- Only `daily-brief.html` footer correctly links to itself

**Fix:** Change all footer "Daily Brief" links to `daily-brief.html`

---

### 5. ✅ **Good: Core Navigation Works**
**Impact:** Positive

The 5 main pages (landing, tools, blog, pricing, quality) are correctly cross-linked via:
- ✅ Navigation bar
- ✅ Footer "Product" section
- ✅ Cross-link sections at bottom of pages

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Placeholders
```bash
# Replace these ASAP:
#   All "Log in" → login.html or remove
#   All "Sign up" → signup.html or remove
#   All "Daily Brief" footer → daily-brief.html
#   All CTA buttons → actual destinations or forms
```

### Priority 2: Create Missing Pages
Create these pages or redirect to existing ones:
- `login.html`, `signup.html`
- `about.html`, `contact.html`, `careers.html`
- `privacy.html`, `terms.html`, `imprint.html`
- `documentation.html`, `api.html`

Or: Create one `coming-soon.html` and redirect all placeholders there.

### Priority 3: Standardize Footer/Nav
```bash
# Use the EXACT same footer on all 7 pages
# Use the EXACT same nav on all 7 pages
# Consider: Create _nav.html and _footer.html partials
```

### Priority 4: Fix Blog/Article Links
```bash
# blog.html: Make article cards actually link to article.html
# article.html: Make related cards link to real articles
# Or: Remove clickable cards until articles exist
```
