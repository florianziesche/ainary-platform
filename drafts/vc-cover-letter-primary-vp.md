## DRAFT V1 (Founder-Operator Angle)

**Subject:** Application: Senior Associate, Vertical AI — Founder-Operator Background

Dear Jason,

I built vertical AI SaaS from 0 → $3.5M equity (BMW, Siemens, Bosch as clients). Now I want to help funds identify and win the next generation of vertical AI companies.

**Why Primary:**
- Your focus on Vertical AI aligns perfectly with my 6 years building industry-specific AI solutions (computer vision for manufacturing)
- Incubation support: I've incubated businesses from concept → product-market fit → scale
- Founder-operator DNA: I know what makes or breaks vertical AI companies because I've lived it

**What I bring:**
1. **Diligence + Deal Sourcing:** Built 25 AI company research reports (avg QA 86/100) in 2 weeks using multi-model agentic pipeline
2. **Financial Modeling:** Raised $5M total ($3.5M equity + $1.5M grants), deep experience with cap tables, unit economics, and market sizing
3. **Vertical AI Expertise:** Built AI for manufacturing (CV-based quality control), automotive (BMW pilot), and enterprise (Siemens deployment)
4. **Incubation:** Currently building an AI Workforce Management Platform (dogfooding → pilot → scale)

**Recent Work:**
- 50-fund VC pipeline analysis (Glasswing, Radical, Conviction, etc.)
- AgentTrust Framework (open-source trust layer for AI agents — "as big as LangChain")
- Research engine: $1.34/report using multi-model routing (Haiku → Sonnet → Opus)

**Why now:**
I spent 6 years as CEO/MD/COO. I know how to build. Now I want to leverage that experience to help founders at scale — and learn from the best investors in Vertical AI.

**What you'd get:**
- A founder-operator who can smell product-market fit from 100 miles away
- Deep technical + business acumen (I can read code AND P&Ls)
- Relentless execution (ask anyone who's worked with me)

I'd love to discuss how I can support your Vertical AI investments and incubation efforts.

Best,
Florian Ziesche

## DRAFT V2 (Research + Rigor Angle)

Dear Jason,

I just built 25 AI company research reports in 2 weeks — average quality score 86/100 — using a multi-model agentic pipeline I designed.

That's the kind of rigor and speed I'd bring to Primary's Vertical AI investments.

**Why I'm a fit:**
- **Founder-Operator:** Built vertical AI SaaS from 0 → $3.5M equity (BMW, Siemens, Bosch clients)
- **Diligence Rigor:** Created Budget-CoCoA (calibrated confidence scoring) to eliminate AI hallucinations in research — $0.005/check vs. $5K-$50K failure cost
- **Vertical AI Expertise:** 6 years building industry-specific AI (computer vision, manufacturing, automotive)

**What I've shipped recently:**
- AgentTrust Framework (open-source trust layer for AI agents)
- 50-fund VC pipeline analysis (Glasswing, Radical, Conviction, etc.)
- Research engine: $1.34/report, multi-model routing, production-ready

**Why Primary:**
Your Vertical AI thesis is exactly where I've spent the last 6 years. I know what separates winners from "AI wrapper" startups:
1. Deep domain expertise (not generic LLM wrappers)
2. Data moats (proprietary datasets >> generic fine-tuning)
3. Distribution advantages (embedded in workflows, not bolted on)

I'd love to discuss how I can support your deal flow, diligence, and incubation work.

Best,
Florian Ziesche

## DRAFT V3 (Vertical AI Thesis Angle)

Dear Jason,

The best vertical AI companies don't start with technology — they start with deep domain pain.

I learned that building vertical AI SaaS for manufacturing (BMW, Siemens, Bosch). Now I want to help Primary identify and win the next generation of these companies.

**My background:**
- **Built Vertical AI:** 6 years as CEO/MD/COO at 36ZERO Vision (computer vision SaaS)
- **Raised Capital:** $5M total ($3.5M equity + $1.5M grants) from German VCs + government
- **Scaled Enterprise:** BMW, Siemens, Bosch as clients — I know how vertical AI sells into Fortune 500

**What I bring:**
1. **Founder Empathy:** I've been in the trenches. I know what founders need (and what they don't say they need).
2. **Technical + Business Fluency:** I can review architecture AND unit economics.
3. **Research Rigor:** Built 25 AI company reports (QA 86/100) using multi-model agentic pipeline I designed.

**Why now:**
I spent 6 years building one company. I want to leverage that hard-won expertise to help dozens of founders — and learn from the best investors in Vertical AI.

**Why Primary:**
- Your Vertical AI focus is exactly where I have the deepest expertise
- Your incubation model aligns with how I think about company building
- I want to work with investors who understand that Vertical AI ≠ "ChatGPT wrapper"

15-min call to discuss?

Best,
Florian Ziesche

## KEY TALKING POINTS (Interview Prep)

**1. What makes a great Vertical AI company?**
- Deep domain expertise (founders who've lived the pain)
- Proprietary data moats (not just fine-tuned GPT)
- Distribution advantages (embedded in workflows, not bolted on)
- Measurable ROI (time saved, costs reduced, revenue increased)

**2. How do you evaluate Vertical AI opportunities?**
- Domain-specific benchmarks (accuracy ≠ everything)
- Data acquisition strategy (how do they get better over time?)
- Go-to-market (PLG? Enterprise sales? Hybrid?)
- Competitive moats (why can't OpenAI/Google do this?)

**3. What's your edge as a former founder?**
- I know what founders don't tell investors (the real pain points)
- I can smell product-market fit (vs. "we have traction" BS)
- I understand the build vs. buy calculus (when to outsource vs. build in-house)

**4. Why leave building to join VC?**
- I want to leverage my hard-won expertise to help dozens of founders, not just one company
- I've learned more from failing than succeeding — I want to help founders avoid my mistakes
- I'm at my best when I'm pattern-matching across multiple companies (not deep in one)

**5. What's your thesis on Vertical AI?**
- We're in the "picks and shovels" phase of AI (infrastructure > apps)
- BUT: Vertical AI apps with domain moats will win because they have proprietary data + distribution
- The future is NOT "ChatGPT for X" — it's domain-specific models trained on proprietary datasets
