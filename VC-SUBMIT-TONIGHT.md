## PRIORITY 1/3: HOF Capital ⭐ **PERFECT FIT**

**Deadline:** Feb 28  
**Why perfect:** "AI or SWE experience REQUIRED" ← You.  
**Apply:** https://www.workstream.us/j/b3ae1199/hof-capital/new-york-4978/venture-capital-analyst-ai-or-swe-experience-required-9b82a0aa

### Your Cover Letter (READY):

```
Subject: VC Analyst Application — AI Builder Transitioning to VC

Dear HOF Capital Investment Team,

Your requirement for AI or SWE experience is exactly why I'm reaching out. I don't just evaluate AI companies — I build production AI systems.

Background:
• 5 years as startup CEO, raised €5.5M across equity and grants
• Built a legal AI platform achieving <0.2% hallucination rate using multi-agent verification architecture (BM25 + semantic retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, 4-agent verification pipeline)
• MD/COO at 36ZERO Vision, a cloud computer vision SaaS company in Munich
• Currently building CNC manufacturing AI and advising European startups on AI implementation

What I bring to HOF Capital:
1. Technical depth to evaluate AI/deep tech investments — I can read code, assess architectures, and pressure-test technical claims
2. Operator perspective on what separates "cool demo" from "production system" — critical for early-stage AI diligence
3. Fundraising experience from both sides of the table — raised capital as a founder, now ready to deploy it
4. Global network across NYC and European AI/startup ecosystems

I'm particularly drawn to HOF Capital's conviction in generational companies. Your portfolio (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) shows you identify paradigm-shifting AI companies early. My daily practice building AI systems gives me the technical intuition to help you continue doing so.

I'm based in NYC and available for an in-person conversation at your Bond Street office.

## PRIORITY 2/3: Betaworks 🚀 **BUILDER-FOCUSED**

**Why great:** AI Camp, Agent Systems, Product-focused VC  
**Apply:** Check https://www.vcplatform.com/jobs or https://betaworks.com/careers

### Your Cover Letter (READY):

```
Subject: Investment Associate — Builder Who Lives Agent Systems Daily

Hi Betaworks team,

I saw your Agent Systems Camp announcement and thought: "I'm literally building this right now."

My daily workflow involves multi-agent AI systems with autonomous planning, memory management, and proactive execution — the exact thesis of your Spring '26 Camp. I don't just invest in these ideas; I ship them.

Background:
• 5 years startup CEO (€5.5M raised), built AI products from zero to production
• Currently running multi-agent systems daily: legal AI with <0.2% hallucination rate, manufacturing AI for CNC production, and an AI orchestration layer that manages my workflow
• MD/COO at 36ZERO Vision (cloud computer vision SaaS)

What makes me different from typical associate candidates:
• I can evaluate AI founders technically — architecture, scaling challenges, data moats
• I understand "demo to production" gaps firsthand — the biggest risk in AI investing
• I build in public — shipping AI tools, writing about the process, engaging the community

Betaworks' approach of building and investing resonates deeply. You don't just write checks — you build companies. That's exactly the kind of VC I want to be.

I'm NYC-based and would love to discuss how my builder background can strengthen Betaworks' AI thesis.

## PRIORITY 3/3: Leonis Capital 🧠 **RESEARCH-DRIVEN**

**Why strong:** Partner-track, Research-focused, AI-native companies  
**Apply:** https://www.vcstack.com/job (check Leonis listing)

### Your Cover Letter (READY):

```
Subject: Associate Application — Technical Founder Ready to Back the Next Wave

Dear Leonis Capital team,

"The first partner for technical founders" — that line resonated because I've been on the other side. As a technical founder who raised €5.5M and built production AI systems, I know what early-stage technical founders actually need from their first investor.

Why I want to join Leonis specifically:
• Your research-heavy approach mirrors how I work — I build conviction through deep technical understanding, not pattern matching
• The Leonis AI 100 demonstrates the kind of systematic market mapping I do naturally
• AI-native focus aligns with my daily practice building production AI systems

What I'd contribute:
1. Technical diligence depth — I can evaluate AI architectures, assess data moats, and identify the difference between a wrapper and a platform
2. Research capabilities — systematic, source-cited, signal-over-noise (built knowledge systems processing 100+ AI research sources)
3. Founder empathy — I've been in the trenches with fundraising, hiring, pivoting. I know what support founders actually value vs. what VCs think they want
4. Production AI experience — legal AI (<0.2% hallucination), computer vision SaaS, manufacturing AI

I'd love to discuss how my operator-researcher hybrid profile fits your team.
