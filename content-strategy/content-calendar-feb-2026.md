## Quick-Start für Morgen (3. Feb)

### Post 1 (LinkedIn, 8:00 AM NYC / 2:00 PM CET):
```
I raised €5.5M as a founder.

Built a computer vision startup from zero to 15 employees.
Led the company through COVID, chip shortages, and a funding winter.

Now I'm learning venture capital from the other side.

Here's what surprised me most:

As a founder, I thought I understood what VCs wanted.
I was wrong.

The pitch that got me funded? 
Looking back, it succeeded despite my pitch, not because of it.

What actually mattered:
→ The team's ability to learn fast
→ Market timing (luck I didn't recognize)
→ A technical edge competitors couldn't copy

What didn't matter as much as I thought:
→ My detailed financial projections
→ The 50-slide deck
→ The "perfect" story

Now, sitting in VC Lab, I see pitches from the other side.

The pattern is clear:
Founders optimize for the wrong things.

More on this soon.

—

What surprised you most about switching roles in your career?
```

### Post 2 (Twitter, after Monique meeting):
```
Just demoed my AI workflow to a VC.

Her question: "How do you actually use AI day-to-day?"

My setup:
• AI reads 144 articles/week → surfaces 5 that matter
• Morning briefing with calendar + priorities
• Research assistant that never forgets context

Her reaction: "This is what I want to see in founders."

The bar is rising.
```
