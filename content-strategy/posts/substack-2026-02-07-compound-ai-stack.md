# THE COMPOUND AI STACK
## How I Actually Use AI Daily

Most people use AI like a search engine.

Ask a question. Get an answer. Forget everything.

I use AI like an employee. One that never forgets, never sleeps, and gets better every day.

Here's the exact system I've built over the past year — from failed experiments to what actually works.

## The Problem I Was Solving

As a startup CEO, I was drowning:
- 200+ emails/day
- Endless research rabbit holes
- Context switching that killed deep work
- Knowledge that disappeared into Notion graveyards

When I started transitioning to venture capital, it got worse. Now I needed to:
- Track hundreds of startups
- Stay current on AI/tech trends
- Build relationships across an entirely new network
- Learn an industry while pretending I already knew it

Something had to change.

## The Stack

### Layer 1: The Knowledge Engine

**Tool:** OpenClaw + Blogwatcher + Obsidian

Every week, my AI reads 144 articles from 10 carefully curated sources:
- Sequoia, YC, Greylock (VC perspectives)
- Stratechery, Not Boring, Lenny's (analysis)
- Newcomer, The Generalist (industry news)

But here's the thing: I don't read 144 articles.

The AI extracts:
- Key insights (2-3 bullets per article)
- Contrarian takes worth noting
- Connections to things I'm already tracking

I read a weekly digest. ~15 minutes. The signal, not the noise.

**The compound effect:** After 3 months, I have a searchable knowledge base of 1,500+ curated insights. When I meet a founder in vertical X, I can pull up everything I've learned about that space — instantly.

---

### Layer 2: The Daily Operating System

**Morning (5 minutes):**
- AI briefing: Calendar, priorities, overnight emails
- One question: "What's the ONE thing today?"

**During work:**
- Research requests → AI does first pass, I refine
- Email drafts → AI writes, I edit (2 min vs 15 min)
- Meeting prep → AI pulls context from past notes

**Evening (3 minutes):**
- Capture what I learned
- Quick brain dump of tomorrow's priorities
- AI suggests what I'm forgetting

---

### Layer 3: The Memory Layer

This is where most AI setups fail.

ChatGPT conversations disappear. Claude projects get cluttered. Nothing connects.

My solution: **Everything flows to Obsidian.**

- Meeting notes → Obsidian
- Research insights → Obsidian  
- Random ideas → Obsidian
- AI conversations worth keeping → Obsidian

But Obsidian alone is just a fancy folder system.

The magic: **Atomic notes with bidirectional links.**

When I write a note about "Microsoft's OpenAI dependency," it automatically connects to:
- My notes on AI concentration risk
- The fund research on Crusoe (alternative AI infra)
- My thesis on vertical AI defensibility

The AI helps me see patterns I'd miss.

---

### Layer 4: The Agent Layer

Here's where it gets interesting.

I don't just use AI for Q&A. I have specialized "agents" for different jobs:

**HUNTER** — Job search agent
- Researches target funds
- Drafts tailored applications
- Tracks my pipeline (applied → responded → interviewing)

**RESEARCHER** — Deep dive agent
- Goes deep on any topic
- Returns with synthesized insights, not raw dumps
- Always cites sources

**WRITER** — Content agent
- Drafts posts from bullet points
- Maintains my voice across platforms
- Repurposes: 1 idea → LinkedIn + Twitter + Newsletter

Each agent has clear instructions, knows my context, and improves over time.

## What I Got Wrong (So You Don't Have To)

### Mistake 1: Tool hopping
I tried 15+ AI tools before settling on this stack. Most were distractions. Pick fewer tools, go deeper.

### Mistake 2: Not capturing outputs
Early on, I'd have great AI conversations and lose them. Now: if it's valuable, it goes to Obsidian. Period.

### Mistake 3: Generic prompts
"Write me a LinkedIn post" → garbage.
"Write a LinkedIn post about X, in my voice (direct, no fluff), for an audience of Y, with a hook that challenges conventional wisdom" → actually useful.

### Mistake 4: No feedback loops
AI doesn't improve unless you tell it what worked. I rate outputs, correct mistakes, and the system learns.

## The Results

**Before:**
- 3-4 hours/day on email and research
- Knowledge scattered across 5 tools
- Constantly feeling behind

**After:**
- 45 min/day on email and research
- Single source of truth
- Actually staying ahead of the curve

**The real win:** Compound knowledge.

Every insight builds on the last. Every connection I make is captured. Every pattern becomes visible over time.

This is how AI should work — not as a party trick, but as infrastructure for thinking.

If this was useful, share it with one person who's drowning in AI tool options.
