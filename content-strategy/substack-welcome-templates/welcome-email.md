Hey!

Thanks for subscribing.

As promised, here are the templates I use to run my AI-powered workflow:

**[DOWNLOAD LINK]**

Inside you'll find:

📄 **SOUL.md** — The personality layer that makes AI actually useful. This is how you turn a generic chatbot into a personalized assistant that knows your priorities, style, and goals.

🤖 **AGENTS.md** — How to set up specialized AI agents. Stop using one AI for everything. Create specialists for research, writing, strategy, and more.

📰 **RSS Feed List** — The 10 sources I follow to stay informed without drowning. Curated for AI, VC, and tech strategy.

---

**How to use these:**

1. **SOUL.md** → Customize with your info → Give to Claude/ChatGPT/your AI tool
2. **AGENTS.md** → Pick 2-3 agents to start → Add to your AI's context
3. **RSS Feeds** → Add to your reader → Set up weekly review ritual

The goal isn't to copy my setup. It's to build YOUR system that compounds over time.

---

**What's coming:**

Every Friday, I share what I'm learning about:
- Using AI as infrastructure, not just a tool
- The founder → VC transition (I'm living it)
- Building systems that compound

If this isn't for you, no hard feelings — unsubscribe anytime.

If it is, hit reply and tell me your #1 challenge with AI workflows. I read every response.

— Florian

P.S. — If you found this useful, share it with one person who's drowning in AI tool options. [SHARE LINK]
