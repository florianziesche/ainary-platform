## Blockers Analysis

| Blocker | Frequency | Real Cause | Solution |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------|
| "Not ready" | High | Perfectionism | 80% sent > 100% in drafts |
| "No time" | Medium | Priority confusion | 2 min to send email |
| "Forgot" | Low | No system | run send-enforcer.sh daily |
| "Fear" | Hidden | Rejection anxiety | Rejection = data |

---

## The Math

From MEMORY.md analysis:
- **€421/day opportunity cost** without outreach
- **4 days without sends** (Feb 3-5) = **€1,684 lost**
- **Target: €500K** / 365 days = **€1,370/day needed**

Every day without sends = 30% of daily target lost.
